Nothing I was with bunking, running around the school be rooted teachers. And everything. And then now I'm here, it's more serious and. More like chill. When you first came though, a year and a half ago, what did you. Did you expect? The pupil referral unit? Kind of sounds a little bit scary. What did you expect when you. When I first arrived, I was expecting it to be like all the. Kids are misbehaved and they're not as relaxing. As they are. So it was different than you expected. Heath's school does seem a bit different and it's ranked as good by Ofsted, outstanding in many areas. Which isn't the case with all prus. So I'm keen to hear from the head, Alex Wilson.
