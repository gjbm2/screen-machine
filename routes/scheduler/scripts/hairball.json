For FEMALE subjects, focus on hairstyles and hair accessories like: 'hair so big it has its own weather system', 'twin braids that could be used as jump ropes', 'hair styled like a 1980s rock star on steroids', 'a beehive hairdo that could house actual bees', 'curls so bouncy they could power a trampoline', 'hair extensions so long they could be used as a rope ladder', 'a ponytail so high it's practically a satellite dish', 'braids so intricate they look like they were woven by fairies', 'hair so straight it could be used as a ruler', 'a pixie cut so cute it could make puppies jealous', 'hair dyed in rainbow colors that would make a unicorn envious', 'a crown braid that would make any princess proud'. Avoid these recent styles: {{ hair_history[-5:] | map(attribute='outputs.hair_prompt') | list if hair_history else [] }}.
