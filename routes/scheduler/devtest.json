And stuff that he needs to make it work. He hopes that. By emulator. Today he's got something that we can start actually talking about. What does it say? What does it imply about that? I haven't got anything yet on Top line assumptions. I think I'm going to start by making something. Up and then ask. Kevin to help me fill in the gaps of. Yeah, there is a thing emerging. It starts. Honest, I don't think either them is quite forced. I think either of them has sort of been. Had a gun to their head. Say, I need something by the end of. The day today, and you would get something. You'd get something quite quickly. It might not be. It might not be very refined. What kind of timeline do they think? As in, I can even make six? Or 12 months out. I think he's much more focused in next two months kind of thing. I. I normally place to work. No, what Kevin's working on. Is a short to medium term thingy and he's going to be using the. He'll be using notion for that, but he's also started thinking about. Out what the sort of forecast. Machinery might need to look like as well that to feed into. Reforecasting, is it? Exactly. For what said's called six plus. Six, I think. Why is it called six plus six? I don't know. Because. Said French? No, that's how big companies do. Forecast fore. There we go. Six months. That's what they call it. Twelve. No, because it's the one, that midget it comes from. Just so you know, because this is what big companies do, and I lived in this world. Right. So you have a fine that. Team, and they talk about these in their big deals, and it's like six months. Real six month forecast. You sometimes do a three plus nine and you do a nine plus three. Of things are miles off. And it's just the way big companies talk about how they do their forecasting. They talk about. Of real and months of forecast as you go midway through the year. Is it worth doing a nine plus three? Yeah. Things are miles off. Let's do a nine plus three this year. Didn't do one last year. You'd get that in Sainsbury's and ensure. Shop there. He's using standard Big Co language, probably because it's a McKinsey thing. McKinsey probably taught it to half the companies in the Footsie. 100 exactly. And. Solve it each time for a million bucks a pop, right? Exactly. So. I think whatever it's called, it's a view to the end of the year, and we said we were going to. Reforecast because we knew we didn't know what we were doing at the beginning of the year, so fair enough. The bits that I'm. So you have. You'll have. Something, Glenn. Quite soon. But not tomorrow. You'll have something by the end of this week or. Certainly by the end of next week, but it's then going to need to go through a couple of cycles. Before and challenge sessions, that's fine. We just need to start. We're not trying to come up with an answer by the end of this week. We need to get to the point where we can actually have a start to have this interval conversation of. Okay, Right. If we're going to have this kind of top line, do we actually. Actually believe that? Because if we actually believe that, that implies that I need to go do priority people. Should I go and hire people based off this plan or do we actually want to be more research that kind of gone the same? Station the competition to get to or. Hey, I need to be actually. Using half the engineering team to make this automation here because otherwise I would have to hire 20. Thousand people. Boom. Perfect. Yeah. The hard bit, I think, by the way, is not going to be what's the forecast? I think. It's going to be that what Claire would like them to do is to hire three more people. All, and I don't think they should, but anyway. You know, jumping forward a bit. Are we back in that debate of humans versus. Effort on automation. We're back in time to get to that debate. We haven't had that debate ages, and it's just kind of we've got lucky because we kind of. Missed the top one forecast, so we've been able to get away with not having the delay. And if we.

So you have a fine that. Team, and they talk about these in their big deals, and it's like six months. Real six month forecast. You sometimes do a three plus nine and you do a nine plus three. Of things are miles off. And it's just the way big companies talk about how they do their forecasting. They talk about. Of real and months of forecast as you go midway through the year. Is it worth doing a nine plus three? Yeah. Things are miles off. Let's do a nine plus three this year. Didn't do one last year. You'd get that in Sainsbury's and ensure. Shop there. He's using standard Big Co language, probably because it's a McKinsey thing. McKinsey probably taught it to half the companies in the Footsie. 100 exactly. And. Solve it each time for a million bucks a pop, right? Exactly. So. I think whatever it's called, it's a view to the end of the year, and we said we were going to. Reforecast because we knew we didn't know what we were doing at the beginning of the year, so fair enough. The bits that I'm. So you have. You'll have. Something, Glenn. Quite soon. But not tomorrow. You'll have something by the end of this week or. Certainly by the end of next week, but it's then going to need to go through a couple of cycles. Before and challenge sessions, that's fine. We just need to start. We're not trying to come up with an answer by the end of this week. We need to get to the point where we can actually have a start to have this interval conversation of. Okay, Right. If we're going to have this kind of top line, do we actually. Actually believe that? Because if we actually believe that, that implies that I need to go do priority people. Should I go and hire people based off this plan or do we actually want to be more research that kind of gone the same? Station the competition to get to or. Hey, I need to be actually. Using half the engineering team to make this automation here because otherwise I would have to hire 20. Thousand people. Boom. Perfect. Yeah. The hard bit, I think, by the way, is not going to be what's the forecast? I think. It's going to be that what Claire would like them to do is to hire three more people. All, and I don't think they should, but anyway. You know, jumping forward a bit. Are we back in that debate of humans versus. Effort on automation. We're back in time to get to that debate. We haven't had that debate ages, and it's just kind of we've got lucky because we kind of. Missed the top one forecast, so we've been able to get away with not having the delay. And if we. You haven't missed this appointment with a big. Fuck, yeah. Well, there's a silver lining on a shit black pound. Yeah. Every enormous turd has a silver lining. Thanks for singing. Positive. Back. At the same time, it had been like. Car crash and. Yeah, I'm. I'm pushing that. Yeah, I'm pushing that. Out. We haven't got to the important bit yet, which is actually making. The conversations happen. The model isn't there yet, and as. So it's a bit tricky to figure out exactly what point of arity to do the model that has the right. Level of sophistication, but you can actually run some simple scenarios off. And, yeah, the other thing is, I actually. It all comes down to actually, how you calibrate it is the truth, right? That's what. Just make sure Pete does. It's like. Okay, calibrate it off so that put the nose. That we did in solar in and see what it spits out. A calibrator of February.",

As in, I can even make six? Or 12 months out. I think he's much more focused in next two months kind of thing. I. I normally place to work. No, what Kevin's working on. Is a short to medium term thingy and he's going to be using the. He'll be using notion for that, but he's also started thinking about. Out what the sort of forecast. Machinery might need to look like as well that to feed into. Reforecasting, is it? Exactly. For what said's called six plus. Six, I think. Why is it called six plus six? I don't know. Because. Said French? No, that's how big companies do. Forecast fore. There we go. Six months. That's what they call it. Twelve. No, because it's the one, that midget it comes from. Just so you know, because this is what big companies do, and I lived in this world. Right. So you have a fine that. Team, and they talk about these in their big deals, and it's like six months. Real six month forecast. You sometimes do a three plus nine and you do a nine plus three. Of things are miles off. And it's just the way big companies talk about how they do their forecasting. They talk about. Of real and months of forecast as you go midway through the year. Is it worth doing a nine plus three? Yeah. Things are miles off. Let's do a nine plus three this year. Didn't do one last year. You'd get that in Sainsbury's and ensure. Shop there. He's using standard Big Co language, probably because it's a McKinsey thing. McKinsey probably taught it to half the companies in the Footsie. 100 exactly. And. Solve it each time for a million bucks a pop, right? Exactly. So. I think whatever it's called, it's a view to the end of the year, and we said we were going to. Reforecast because we knew we didn't know what we were doing at the beginning of the year, so fair enough. The bits that I'm. So you have. You'll have. Something, Glenn. Quite soon. But not tomorrow. You'll have something by the end of this week or. Certainly by the end of next week, but it's then going to need to go through a couple of cycles. Before and challenge sessions, that's fine. We just need to start. We're not trying to come up with an answer by the end of this week. We need to get to the point where we can actually have a start to have this interval conversation of. Okay, Right. If we're going to have this kind of top line, do we actually. Actually believe that? Because if we actually believe that, that implies that I need to go do priority people. Should I go and hire people based off this plan or do we actually want to be more research that kind of gone the same? Station the competition to get to or. Hey, I need to be actually. Using half the engineering team to make this automation here because otherwise I would have to hire 20. Thousand people. Boom. Perfect. Yeah. The hard bit, I think, by the way, is not going to be what's the forecast? I think. It's going to be that what Claire would like them to do is to hire three more people. All, and I don't think they should, but anyway. You know, jumping forward a bit. Are we back in that debate of humans versus. Effort on automation. We're back in time to get to that debate. We haven't had that debate ages, and it's just kind of we've got lucky because we kind of. Missed the top one forecast, so we've been able to get away with not having the delay. And if we.

        "raw_text": "in this world. Right. So you have a fine that. Team, and they talk about these in their big deals, and it's like six months. Real six month forecast. You sometimes do a three plus nine and you do a nine plus three. Of things are miles off. And it's just the way big companies talk about how they do their forecasting. They talk about. Of real and months of forecast as you go midway through the year. Is it worth doing a nine plus three? Yeah. Things are miles off. Let's do a nine plus three this year. Didn't do one last year. You'd get that in Sainsbury's and ensure. Shop there. He's using standard Big Co language, probably because it's a McKinsey thing. McKinsey probably taught it to half the companies in the Footsie. 100 exactly. And. Solve it each time for a million bucks a pop, right? Exactly. So. I think whatever it's called, it's a view to the end of the year, and we said we were going to. Reforecast because we knew we didn't know what we were doing at the beginning of the year, so fair enough. The bits that I'm. So you have. You'll have. Something, Glenn. Quite soon. But not tomorrow. You'll have something by the end of this week or. Certainly by the end of next week, but it's then going to need to go through a couple of cycles. Before and challenge sessions, that's fine. We just need to start. We're not trying to come up with an answer by the end of this week. We need to get to the point where we can actually have a start to have this interval conversation of. Okay, Right. If we're going to have this kind of top line, do we actually. Actually believe that? Because if we actually believe that, that implies that I need to go do priority people. Should I go and hire people based off this plan or do we actually want to be more research that kind of gone the same? Station the competition to get to or. Hey, I need to be actually. Using half the engineering team to make this automation here because otherwise I would have to hire 20. Thousand people. Boom. Perfect. Yeah. The hard bit, I think, by the way, is not going to be what's the forecast? I think. It's going to be that what Claire would like them to do is to hire three more people. All, and I don't think they should, but anyway. You know, jumping forward a bit. Are we back in that debate of humans versus. Effort on automation. We're back in time to get to that debate. We haven't had that debate ages, and it's just kind of we've got lucky because we kind of. Missed the top one forecast, so we've been able to get away with not having the delay. And if we. You haven't missed this appointment with a big. Fuck, yeah. Well, there's a silver lining on a shit black pound. Yeah. Every enormous turd has a silver lining. Thanks for singing. Positive. Back. At the same time, it had been like. Car crash and. Yeah, I'm. I'm pushing that. Yeah, I'm pushing that. Out. We haven't got to the important bit yet, which is actually making. The conversations happen. The model isn't there yet, and as. So it's a bit tricky to figure out exactly what point of arity to do the model that has the right. Level of sophistication, but you can actually run some simple scenarios off. And, yeah, the other thing is, I actually. It all comes down to actually, how you calibrate it is the truth, right? That's what. Just make sure Pete does. It's like. Okay, calibrate it off so that put the nose. That we did in solar in and see what it spits out. A calibrator of February. Put the actual number of switches in February through your assumptions and see does it spit out the line? Because otherwise I have a super sophisticated model that just, like, spits out garbage. 2 yeah. Okay? I can get him back. That bot is going to do all the work, and we don't need more people. We. Just need a better chat bot. Well, I don't really have a sense of how much of the. Work is in WhatsApp. No, I don't have good visibility to any of that, really. The moment. And that's kind of what I'm trying to say. Can we try? Does it make sense? Divide the work into different types, because at the moment, I don't really have an idea. Do. Yes. How much more work are we going to push into the. Chat bot hell quickly, I guess. Yeah. And as ever as I started pulling into going to omni number I'm again like, shit, we're just not really. Looking to do the right things. We made this change with. We saw that energy proposal rates had come down, we made this change. Change. It doesn't look like it's going back up, and I. Noticing that because I'm pretty bought in numbers. Repeat energy proposal rates have gone down. We may what? Change. Should we make the other thing right? When we took it up when rev work? Buying products. We changed the blueprint ordering. Yeah. Do not offer energy first because there's no energy. We don't. It. Forgot to change it back. No, I know. And that was one thing we fixed. Yeah, we fixed. Fixed it with the expectation that energy proposal rates would go up. They haven't. Proposal rates haven't gone up. No. Rate, not acceptance rates, proposal rates. Proposal rates haven't got. Okay, that's interesting. So we've reverted back to what we were doing before. Four. But proposal rates have not gone back to where they were before. For me, like.

The conversations happen. The model isn't there yet, and as. So it's a bit tricky to figure out exactly what point of arity to do the model that has the right. Level of sophistication, but you can actually run some simple scenarios off. And, yeah, the other thing is, I actually. It all comes down to actually, how you calibrate it is the truth, right? That's what. Just make sure Pete does. It's like. Okay, calibrate it off so that put the nose. That we did in solar in and see what it spits out. A calibrator of February. Put the actual number of switches in February through your assumptions and see does it spit out the line? Because otherwise I have a super sophisticated model that just, like, spits out garbage. 2 yeah. Okay? I can get him back. That bot is going to do all the work, and we don't need more people. We. Just need a better chat bot. Well, I don't really have a sense of how much of the. Work is in WhatsApp. No, I don't have good visibility to any of that, really. The moment. And that's kind of what I'm trying to say. Can we try? Does it make sense? Divide the work into different types, because at the moment, I don't really have an idea. Do. Yes. How much more work are we going to push into the. Chat bot hell quickly, I guess. Yeah. And as ever as I started pulling into going to omni number I'm again like, shit, we're just not really. Looking to do the right things. We made this change with. We saw that energy proposal rates had come down, we made this change. Change. It doesn't look like it's going back up, and I. Noticing that because I'm pretty bought in numbers. Repeat energy proposal rates have gone down. We may what? Change. Should we make the other thing right? When we took it up when rev work? Buying products. We changed the blueprint ordering. Yeah. Do not offer energy first because there's no energy. We don't. It. Forgot to change it back. No, I know. And that was one thing we fixed. Yeah, we fixed. Fixed it with the expectation that energy proposal rates would go up. They haven't. Proposal rates haven't gone up. No. Rate, not acceptance rates, proposal rates. Proposal rates haven't got. Okay, that's interesting. So we've reverted back to what we were doing before. Four. But proposal rates have not gone back to where they were before. For me, like. Spending, like, 15 minutes looking and going, this is pretty weird. That's like a bruise. And my better conclusion is, why am I realizing this? By trying to fill in some assumptions for Pete. Yeah. This is back to sort of there aren't the right. Sort of real time. I don't mean real time as in like subsecond. I mean as in. Day to day reporting machine machining so that you can see. At a glance. Is everything working properly and not just in sort of the stuff that's. Marked as whip, but the stuff that should be marked as whip or sort of based on flow rates. Yeah, I think that's, like, as and when Ezra has more time. What Ezra did is he got to the point where he was like, oh, it's really complicated. We haven't. Then to. Okay, given it's complicated, what are the set of symbols? Things that we need to be keeping an eye on to make sure the complicated machine is working as. As we think it is. Yeah, I know. Needing for the imprints of stuff. I'd love to spend time with it, which I think we can do. Okay, well, what are the subsidiary metrics? Might be okay.",

Because otherwise I have a super sophisticated model that just, like, spits out garbage. 2 yeah. Okay? I can get him back. That bot is going to do all the work, and we don't need more people. We. Just need a better chat bot. Well, I don't really have a sense of how much of the. Work is in WhatsApp. No, I don't have good visibility to any of that, really. The moment. And that's kind of what I'm trying to say. Can we try? Does it make sense? Divide the work into different types, because at the moment, I don't really have an idea. Do. Yes. How much more work are we going to push into the. Chat bot hell quickly, I guess. Yeah. And as ever as I started pulling into going to omni number I'm again like, shit, we're just not really. Looking to do the right things. We made this change with. We saw that energy proposal rates had come down, we made this change. Change. It doesn't look like it's going back up, and I. Noticing that because I'm pretty bought in numbers. Repeat energy proposal rates have gone down. We may what? Change. Should we make the other thing right? When we took it up when rev work? Buying products. We changed the blueprint ordering. Yeah. Do not offer energy first because there's no energy. We don't. It. Forgot to change it back. No, I know. And that was one thing we fixed. Yeah, we fixed. Fixed it with the expectation that energy proposal rates would go up. They haven't. Proposal rates haven't gone up. No. Rate, not acceptance rates, proposal rates. Proposal rates haven't got. Okay, that's interesting. So we've reverted back to what we were doing before. Four. But proposal rates have not gone back to where they were before. For me, like. Spending, like, 15 minutes looking and going, this is pretty weird. That's like a bruise. And my better conclusion is, why am I realizing this? By trying to fill in some assumptions for Pete. Yeah. This is back to sort of there aren't the right. Sort of real time. I don't mean real time as in like subsecond. I mean as in. Day to day reporting machine machining so that you can see. At a glance. Is everything working properly and not just in sort of the stuff that's. Marked as whip, but the stuff that should be marked as whip or sort of based on flow rates. Yeah, I think that's, like, as and when Ezra has more time. What Ezra did is he got to the point where he was like, oh, it's really complicated. We haven't. Then to. Okay, given it's complicated, what are the set of symbols? Things that we need to be keeping an eye on to make sure the complicated machine is working as. As we think it is. Yeah, I know. Needing for the imprints of stuff. I'd love to spend time with it, which I think we can do. Okay, well, what are the subsidiary metrics? Might be okay. Seven days after. What percentage of people have got, you know, these different. We just always keep an eye on that, and that number should be quite stable. Here. Kevin. Right. So I. I buried Kevin into B2B process dashboard creating. And forecasting, and I've got a list of reports that I. Wish I had, which is just simple stuff. Simple stuff that you kind of want. Emily to keep an eye on with mso, like which providers have which kind of. Which levels of savings and tariffs have different exception rates. Does it matter what we offer? How do we use a kind of, you know, what are we offering? Fe. Feedback loop to propose what we should be offering differently from a kind of commercial standpoint. Total. Totally blind. How much is the level of saving in energy changing, changing our acceptance. Rates? No idea. Because we've gone from, like, having 126 reward to having. Having a 70 pound reward that we're faking a bit higher with a 100 and something pound direct saving. Saving from a fix. I have no idea whether that's made a difference or not. A difference. And whether if that goes up or down, that's going to make another difference. Yeah, which is why the sooner Kevin can get. Through the backlog, urgent backlog, and get into the sort of. The more sensible forward leaning stuff, the better. Stuff. Yeah, exactly. Okay. What's happening on? What's happening on? I gave Ezra the what's happening on Reward dist. Dispensation, who is taking out rewards, who's not. And he did some of it, and then he got bet. Buried. And I put that on Kevin's list. But again, he's not going to get to that for a little while. I'll give you another. Other example, Subscriptions. I have a hunch that we'll discuss. Some quite interesting patterns in which people actually hit Subscribe. So I have this sense that because everyone who came. Through B2B had this kind of sold to them as a this is a free. Thing that work's giving you. They will be less likely to subscribe, but also that they'll be less likely. Likely to have withdrawn their reward. But again, Is what's happening with that whole loop. And what, therefore, should we change about. Are messaging at the beginning. That's another thing I'd love to look at, but that one is too early to look at. I know it's too early to look at, but it will be agree we should within the next two months there'll be data there that will. Interesting stuff.",

Okay, given it's complicated, what are the set of symbols? Things that we need to be keeping an eye on to make sure the complicated machine is working as. As we think it is. Yeah, I know. Needing for the imprints of stuff. I'd love to spend time with it, which I think we can do. Okay, well, what are the subsidiary metrics? Might be okay. Seven days after. What percentage of people have got, you know, these different. We just always keep an eye on that, and that number should be quite stable. Here. Kevin. Right. So I. I buried Kevin into B2B process dashboard creating. And forecasting, and I've got a list of reports that I. Wish I had, which is just simple stuff. Simple stuff that you kind of want. Emily to keep an eye on with mso, like which providers have which kind of. Which levels of savings and tariffs have different exception rates. Does it matter what we offer? How do we use a kind of, you know, what are we offering? Fe. Feedback loop to propose what we should be offering differently from a kind of commercial standpoint. Total. Totally blind. How much is the level of saving in energy changing, changing our acceptance. Rates? No idea. Because we've gone from, like, having 126 reward to having. Having a 70 pound reward that we're faking a bit higher with a 100 and something pound direct saving. Saving from a fix. I have no idea whether that's made a difference or not. A difference. And whether if that goes up or down, that's going to make another difference. Yeah, which is why the sooner Kevin can get. Through the backlog, urgent backlog, and get into the sort of. The more sensible forward leaning stuff, the better. Stuff. Yeah, exactly. Okay. What's happening on? What's happening on? I gave Ezra the what's happening on Reward dist. Dispensation, who is taking out rewards, who's not. And he did some of it, and then he got bet. Buried. And I put that on Kevin's list. But again, he's not going to get to that for a little while. I'll give you another. Other example, Subscriptions. I have a hunch that we'll discuss. Some quite interesting patterns in which people actually hit Subscribe. So I have this sense that because everyone who came. Through B2B had this kind of sold to them as a this is a free. Thing that work's giving you. They will be less likely to subscribe, but also that they'll be less likely. Likely to have withdrawn their reward. But again, Is what's happening with that whole loop. And what, therefore, should we change about. Are messaging at the beginning. That's another thing I'd love to look at, but that one is too early to look at. I know it's too early to look at, but it will be agree we should within the next two months there'll be data there that will. Interesting stuff. You know, who are. Who are our users? Like we. Know we've got the sort codes of every user and we can split them in game space. Details and how active they've been in the service and who they bank with because I paid so many. Monzo sort codes. I feel like I'm just paying Monzo sort codes all the time. When I was manually doing the payment. Are all our users actually Monzo customers. Is that actually a really key demonstration? Graphic stat. Just feels that way. Love to do the analysis. 4o. Four silk codes. I just felt I was paying the whole time. That's one day. This is what you had yet. Do anything to do it, but let's try and get Kevin. Commercial answers. Yes. Go. Tree right there. John, just. I won't do anything. As the thing unless I hear from you, okay, I.",

I feel like I'm just paying Monzo sort codes all the time. When I was manually doing the payment. Are all our users actually Monzo customers. Is that actually a really key demonstration?

        "raw_text": "and I. Noticing that because I'm pretty bought in numbers. Repeat energy proposal rates have gone down. We may what? Change. Should we make the other thing right? When we took it up when rev work? Buying products. We changed the blueprint ordering. Yeah. Do not offer energy first because there's no energy. We don't. It. Forgot to change it back. No, I know. And that was one thing we fixed. Yeah, we fixed. Fixed it with the expectation that energy proposal rates would go up. They haven't. Proposal rates haven't gone up. No. Rate, not acceptance rates, proposal rates. Proposal rates haven't got. Okay, that's interesting. So we've reverted back to what we were doing before. Four. But proposal rates have not gone back to where they were before. For me, like. Spending, like, 15 minutes looking and going, this is pretty weird. That's like a bruise. And my better conclusion is, why am I realizing this? By trying to fill in some assumptions for Pete. Yeah. This is back to sort of there aren't the right. Sort of real time. I don't mean real time as in like subsecond. I mean as in. Day to day reporting machine machining so that you can see. At a glance. Is everything working properly and not just in sort of the stuff that's. Marked as whip, but the stuff that should be marked as whip or sort of based on flow rates. Yeah, I think that's, like, as and when Ezra has more time. What Ezra did is he got to the point where he was like, oh, it's really complicated. We haven't. Then to. Okay, given it's complicated, what are the set of symbols? Things that we need to be keeping an eye on to make sure the complicated machine is working as. As we think it is. Yeah, I know. Needing for the imprints of stuff. I'd love to spend time with it, which I think we can do. Okay, well, what are the subsidiary metrics? Might be okay. Seven days after. What percentage of people have got, you know, these different. We just always keep an eye on that, and that number should be quite stable. Here. Kevin. Right. So I. I buried Kevin into B2B process dashboard creating. And forecasting, and I've got a list of reports that I. Wish I had, which is just simple stuff. Simple stuff that you kind of want. Emily to keep an eye on with mso, like which providers have which kind of. Which levels of savings and tariffs have different exception rates. Does it matter what we offer? How do we use a kind of, you know, what are we offering? Fe. Feedback loop to propose what we should be offering differently from a kind of commercial standpoint. Total. Totally blind. How much is the level of saving in energy changing, changing our acceptance. Rates? No idea. Because we've gone from, like, having 126 reward to having. Having a 70 pound reward that we're faking a bit higher with a 100 and something pound direct saving. Saving from a fix. I have no idea whether that's made a difference or not. A difference. And whether if that goes up or down, that's going to make another difference. Yeah, which is why the sooner Kevin can get. Through the backlog, urgent backlog, and get into the sort of. The more sensible forward leaning stuff, the better. Stuff. Yeah, exactly. Okay. What's happening on? What's happening on? I gave Ezra the what's happening on Reward dist. Dispensation, who is taking out rewards, who's not. And he did some of it, and then he got bet. Buried. And I put that on Kevin's list. But again, he's not going to get to that for a little while. I'll give you another. Other example, Subscriptions. I have a hunch that we'll discuss. Some quite interesting patterns in which people actually hit Subscribe. So I have this sense that because everyone who came. Through B2B had this kind of sold to them as a this is a free. Thing that work's giving you. They will be less likely to subscribe, but also that they'll be less likely. Likely to have withdrawn their reward. But again, Is what's happening with that whole loop. And what, therefore, should we change about. Are messaging at the beginning. That's another thing I'd love to look at, but that one is too early to look at. I know it's too early to look at, but it will be agree we should within the next two months there'll be data there that will. Interesting stuff. You know, who are. Who are our users? Like we.
