So now we've got this other front, if you like, on the transatlantic tensions. Over two, even in Israeli politics. Politicians who are considered very much at the extreme. The interesting thing is this, is that even opponents. Within the Israeli political body of Mr. Smotrich and Mr. Ben Gavir have sort of said this is the wrong move by the European. By the British and the Canadians. But the point is, is that the UK and these other governments are under huge political pressure to act. They've been waiting to play this card. They've now decided to play it. The interesting question now is where the debate goes. Already there's discussions about do they get into a place where they recognize the state of Palestinian, Palestinian state. But that's for another day. For another day. And another day we will indeed be getting Palestinians reaction to that. But for now, our diplomatic correspondent, James Landale. Thanks very much. Indeed. And a bit later on in this program. A bit of defeat for Greenland's national football team after they are refused entry to conquer Gaff. It's the body which governs football in North America. We will keep fighting. Like to get recognized. And that's one of our big dream that someday Greenland can play a World cup qualification match. That's the biggest dream of all Greenlanders right now. I have more from Greenland's Harry Kane a bit later on in the program. Now fireworks. Another objects have been thrown at police during a second night of disorder in Ballamina in Northern Ireland. Last night, a peaceful demonstration over the alleged sexual assault of a girl by two teenagers descended into violence and attacks on the houses of migrants. We can speak to our island correspondent, Chris Page. Now, Chris. Bring us up to speed. First of all, in the background. To all of this. And then perhaps tell us what's happening tonight. Yes. Police again are facing a challenging night this evening. In Ballamina in County Antrim around this time. Last night was really when the trouble broke out initially earlier in the evening. There had been a peaceful march near the city center, attended by hundreds of people protesting about an alleged sexual assault in the town at the weekend. Earlier yesterday. Two teenage boys had appeared in court, charged with the attempted rip of a teenage girl. They were remanded in custody. And they spoke. Via an interpreter in Romanian to confirm their names in the court, which heard that they would be denying those charges. So that demonstration was peaceful. But police say that a number of youths wearing masks broke off from the demonstration.",

We've got the U.S. you know, at odds with European allies over defense spending, continually urging the Europeans to do more. They say they're going to do more, but they're being too slow about it. There are the culture wars between the US And Europe. The vice president, J.D. vance, accusing the Europeans of threatening civil liberties. Of over regulating tech companies. There is the war. Of the trade war. Over terrorists. That, yes, have been diminished. But the trade, those tariffs are US Triumphs are still there. So. So now we've got this other front, if you like, on the transatlantic tensions. Over two, even in Israeli politics. Politicians who are considered very much at the extreme. The interesting thing is this, is that even opponents. Within the Israeli political body of Mr. Smotrich and Mr. Ben Gavir have sort of said this is the wrong move by the European. By the British and the Canadians. But the point is, is that the UK and these other governments are under huge political pressure to act. They've been waiting to play this card. They've now decided to play it. The interesting question now is where the debate goes. Already there's discussions about do they get into a place where they recognize the state of Palestinian, Palestinian state. But that's for another day. For another day. And another day we will indeed be getting Palestinians reaction to that. But for now, our diplomatic correspondent, James Landale. Thanks very much. Indeed. And a bit later on in this program. A bit of defeat for Greenland's national football team after they are refused entry to conquer Gaff. It's the body which governs football in North America. We will keep fighting. Like to get recognized. And that's one of our big dream that someday Greenland can play a World cup qualification match. That's the biggest dream of all Greenlanders right now. I have more from Greenland's Harry Kane a bit later on in the program. Now fireworks. Another objects have been thrown at police during a second night of disorder in Ballamina in Northern Ireland. Last night, a peaceful demonstration over the alleged sexual assault of a girl by two teenagers descended into violence and attacks on the houses of migrants. We can speak to our island correspondent, Chris Page. Now, Chris. Bring us up to speed. First of all, in the background. To all of this. And then perhaps tell us what's happening tonight. Yes. Police again are facing a challenging night this evening. In Ballamina in County Antrim around this time. Last night was really when the trouble broke out initially earlier in the evening. There had been a peaceful march near the city center, attended by hundreds of people protesting about an alleged sexual assault in the town at the weekend. Earlier yesterday. Two teenage boys had appeared in court, charged with the attempted rip of a teenage girl. They were remanded in custody. And they spoke. Via an interpreter in Romanian to confirm their names in the court, which heard that they would be denying those charges. So that demonstration was peaceful. But police say that a number of youths wearing masks broke off from the demonstration. And then began to attack both police officers and the homes of migrants. And today, about half a dozen migrant families have moved out of their homes as a result of what they suffered. Last night, there were four houses set on fire. Windows were smashed of other houses, doors kicked in, and also a number of businesses damaged. Two police officers suffered injuries, 15 of them. Fortunately, all of the minor. So again tonight, police coming under attack in the same area of ballamina. Yeah. And also spreading out across other parts of Northern Ireland. In anticipation of a repeat of the trouble. Yes. Police said today that they were deploying extra resources, as you say, Jamie, across Northern Ireland. To be ready in case there was an escalation. Of trouble. They did say they had no indication at that stage. This is early this afternoon. That there was going to be more violence. But there has been more trouble.",
