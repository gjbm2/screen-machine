That's what they call it. Twelve. No, because it's the one, that midget it comes from. Just so you know, because this is what big companies do, and I lived in this world. Right. So you have a fine that. Team, and they talk about these in their big deals, and it's like six months. Real six month forecast. You sometimes do a three plus nine and you do a nine plus three. Of things are miles off. And it's just the way big companies talk about how they do their forecasting. They talk about. Of real and months of forecast as you go midway through the year. Is it worth doing a nine plus three? Yeah. Things are miles off. Let's do a nine plus three this year. Didn't do one last year. You'd get that in Sainsbury's and ensure. Shop there. He's using standard Big Co language, probably because it's a McKinsey thing. McKinsey probably taught it to half the companies in the Footsie. 100 exactly. And. Solve it each time for a million bucks a pop, right? Exactly. So. I think whatever it's called, it's a view to the end of the year, and we said we were going to. Reforecast because we knew we didn't know what we were doing at the beginning of the year, so fair enough. The bits that I'm. So you have. You'll have. Something, Glenn. Quite soon. But not tomorrow. You'll have something by the end of this week or. Certainly by the end of next week, but it's then going to need to go through a couple of cycles. Before and challenge sessions, that's fine. We just need to start. We're not trying to come up with an answer by the end of this week. We need to get to the point where we can actually have a start to have this interval conversation of. Okay, Right. If we're going to have this kind of top line, do we actually. Actually believe that? Because if we actually believe that, that implies that I need to go do priority people. Should I go and hire people based off this plan or do we actually want to be more research that kind of gone the same? Station the competition to get to or. Hey, I need to be actually. Using half the engineering team to make this automation here because otherwise I would have to hire 20. Thousand people. Boom. Perfect. Yeah. The hard bit, I think, by the way, is not going to be what's the forecast? I think. It's going to be that what Claire would like them to do is to hire three more people. All, and I don't think they should, but anyway. You know, jumping forward a bit. Are we back in that debate of humans versus. Effort on automation. We're back in time to get to that debate. We haven't had that debate ages, and it's just kind of we've got lucky because we kind of. Missed the top one forecast, so we've been able to get away with not having the delay. And if we. You haven't missed this appointment with a big. Fuck, yeah. Well, there's a silver lining on a shit black pound. Yeah. Every enormous turd has a silver lining. Thanks for singing. Positive. Back. At the same time, it had been like. Car crash and. Yeah, I'm. I'm pushing that. Yeah, I'm pushing that. Out. We haven't got to the important bit yet, which is actually making.",

I think I'm going to start by making something. Up and then ask. Kevin to help me fill in the gaps of. Yeah, there is a thing emerging. It starts. Honest, I don't think either them is quite forced. I think either of them has sort of been. Had a gun to their head. Say, I need something by the end of. The day today, and you would get something. You'd get something quite quickly. It might not be. It might not be very refined. What kind of timeline do they think? As in, I can even make six? Or 12 months out. I think he's much more focused in next two months kind of thing. I. I normally place to work. No, what Kevin's working on. Is a short to medium term thingy and he's going to be using the. He'll be using notion for that, but he's also started thinking about. Out what the sort of forecast. Machinery might need to look like as well that to feed into. Reforecasting, is it? Exactly. For what said's called six plus. Six, I think. Why is it called six plus six? I don't know. Because. Said French? No, that's how big companies do. Forecast fore. There we go. Six months. That's what they call it. Twelve. No, because it's the one, that midget it comes from. Just so you know, because this is what big companies do, and I lived in this world. Right. So you have a fine that. Team, and they talk about these in their big deals, and it's like six months. Real six month forecast. You sometimes do a three plus nine and you do a nine plus three. Of things are miles off. And it's just the way big companies talk about how they do their forecasting. They talk about. Of real and months of forecast as you go midway through the year. Is it worth doing a nine plus three? Yeah. Things are miles off. Let's do a nine plus three this year. Didn't do one last year. You'd get that in Sainsbury's and ensure. Shop there. He's using standard Big Co language, probably because it's a McKinsey thing. McKinsey probably taught it to half the companies in the Footsie. 100 exactly. And. Solve it each time for a million bucks a pop, right? Exactly. So. I think whatever it's called, it's a view to the end of the year, and we said we were going to. Reforecast because we knew we didn't know what we were doing at the beginning of the year, so fair enough. The bits that I'm. So you have. You'll have. Something, Glenn. Quite soon. But not tomorrow. You'll have something by the end of this week or. Certainly by the end of next week, but it's then going to need to go through a couple of cycles. Before and challenge sessions, that's fine. We just need to start. We're not trying to come up with an answer by the end of this week. We need to get to the point where we can actually have a start to have this interval conversation of. Okay, Right. If we're going to have this kind of top line, do we actually. Actually believe that? Because if we actually believe that, that implies that I need to go do priority people. Should I go and hire people based off this plan or do we actually want to be more research that kind of gone the same? Station the competition to get to or. Hey, I need to be actually. Using half the engineering team to make this automation here because otherwise I would have to hire 20. Thousand people. Boom. Perfect. Yeah. The hard bit, I think, by the way, is not going to be what's the forecast? I think. It's going to be that what Claire would like them to do is to hire three more people. All, and I don't think they should, but anyway. You know, jumping forward a bit. Are we back in that debate of humans versus. Effort on automation. We're back in time to get to that debate. We haven't had that debate ages, and it's just kind of we've got lucky because we kind of. Missed the top one forecast, so we've been able to get away with not having the delay. And if we.

        "raw_text": "but he's also started thinking about. Out what the sort of forecast. Machinery might need to look like as well that to feed into. Reforecasting, is it? Exactly. For what said's called six plus. Six, I think. Why is it called six plus six? I don't know. Because. Said French? No, that's how big companies do. Forecast fore. There we go. Six months. That's what they call it. Twelve. No, because it's the one, that midget it comes from. Just so you know, because this is what big companies do, and I lived in this world. Right. So you have a fine that. Team, and they talk about these in their big deals, and it's like six months. Real six month forecast. You sometimes do a three plus nine and you do a nine plus three. Of things are miles off. And it's just the way big companies talk about how they do their forecasting. They talk about. Of real and months of forecast as you go midway through the year. Is it worth doing a nine plus three? Yeah. Things are miles off. Let's do a nine plus three this year. Didn't do one last year. You'd get that in Sainsbury's and ensure. Shop there. He's using standard Big Co language, probably because it's a McKinsey thing. McKinsey probably taught it to half the companies in the Footsie. 100 exactly. And. Solve it each time for a million bucks a pop, right? Exactly. So. I think whatever it's called, it's a view to the end of the year, and we said we were going to. Reforecast because we knew we didn't know what we were doing at the beginning of the year, so fair enough. The bits that I'm. So you have. You'll have. Something, Glenn. Quite soon. But not tomorrow. You'll have something by the end of this week or. Certainly by the end of next week, but it's then going to need to go through a couple of cycles. Before and challenge sessions, that's fine. We just need to start. We're not trying to come up with an answer by the end of this week. We need to get to the point where we can actually have a start to have this interval conversation of. Okay, Right. If we're going to have this kind of top line, do we actually. Actually believe that? Because if we actually believe that, that implies that I need to go do priority people. Should I go and hire people based off this plan or do we actually want to be more research that kind of gone the same? Station the competition to get to or. Hey, I need to be actually. Using half the engineering team to make this automation here because otherwise I would have to hire 20. Thousand people. Boom. Perfect. Yeah. The hard bit, I think, by the way, is not going to be what's the forecast? I think. It's going to be that what Claire would like them to do is to hire three more people. All, and I don't think they should, but anyway. You know, jumping forward a bit. Are we back in that debate of humans versus. Effort on automation. We're back in time to get to that debate. We haven't had that debate ages, and it's just kind of we've got lucky because we kind of. Missed the top one forecast, so we've been able to get away with not having the delay. And if we. You haven't missed this appointment with a big. Fuck, yeah. Well, there's a silver lining on a shit black pound. Yeah. Every enormous turd has a silver lining. Thanks for singing. Positive. Back. At the same time, it had been like. Car crash and. Yeah, I'm. I'm pushing that. Yeah, I'm pushing that. Out. We haven't got to the important bit yet, which is actually making. The conversations happen. The model isn't there yet, and as. So it's a bit tricky to figure out exactly what point of arity to do the model that has the right. Level of sophistication, but you can actually run some simple scenarios off. And, yeah, the other thing is, I actually. It all comes down to actually, how you calibrate it is the truth, right? That's what. Just make sure Pete does. It's like. Okay, calibrate it off so that put the nose. That we did in solar in and see what it spits out. A calibrator of February. Put the actual number of switches in February through your assumptions and see does it spit out the line? Because otherwise I have a super sophisticated model that just, like, spits out garbage. 2 yeah. Okay? I can get him back. That bot is going to do all the work, and we don't need more people. We. Just need a better chat bot. Well, I don't really have a sense of how much of the. Work is in WhatsApp. No, I don't have good visibility to any of that, really. The moment. And that's kind of what I'm trying to say. Can we try? Does it make sense? Divide the work into different types, because at the moment, I don't really have an idea. Do. Yes. How much more work are we going to push into the. Chat bot hell quickly, I guess. Yeah. And as ever as I started pulling into going to omni number I'm again like, shit, we're just not really. Looking to do the right things. We made this change with. We saw that energy proposal rates had come down, we made this change. Change. It doesn't look like it's going back up, and I. Noticing that because I'm pretty bought in numbers. Repeat energy proposal rates have gone down. We may what? Change. Should we make the other thing right? When we took it up when rev work?

You haven't missed this appointment with a big. Fuck, yeah. Well, there's a silver lining on a shit black pound. Yeah. Every enormous turd has a silver lining. Thanks for singing. Positive. Back. At the same time, it had been like. Car crash and. Yeah, I'm. I'm pushing that. Yeah, I'm pushing that. Out. We haven't got to the important bit yet, which is actually making. The conversations happen. The model isn't there yet, and as. So it's a bit tricky to figure out exactly what point of arity to do the model that has the right. Level of sophistication, but you can actually run some simple scenarios off. And, yeah, the other thing is, I actually. It all comes down to actually, how you calibrate it is the truth, right? That's what. Just make sure Pete does. It's like. Okay, calibrate it off so that put the nose. That we did in solar in and see what it spits out. A calibrator of February. Put the actual number of switches in February through your assumptions and see does it spit out the line? Because otherwise I have a super sophisticated model that just, like, spits out garbage. 2 yeah. Okay? I can get him back. That bot is going to do all the work, and we don't need more people. We. Just need a better chat bot. Well, I don't really have a sense of how much of the. Work is in WhatsApp. No, I don't have good visibility to any of that, really. The moment. And that's kind of what I'm trying to say. Can we try? Does it make sense? Divide the work into different types, because at the moment, I don't really have an idea. Do. Yes. How much more work are we going to push into the. Chat bot hell quickly, I guess. Yeah. And as ever as I started pulling into going to omni number I'm again like, shit, we're just not really. Looking to do the right things. We made this change with. We saw that energy proposal rates had come down, we made this change. Change. It doesn't look like it's going back up, and I. Noticing that because I'm pretty bought in numbers. Repeat energy proposal rates have gone down. We may what? Change. Should we make the other thing right? When we took it up when rev work? Buying products. We changed the blueprint ordering. Yeah. Do not offer energy first because there's no energy. We don't. It. Forgot to change it back. No, I know. And that was one thing we fixed. Yeah, we fixed. Fixed it with the expectation that energy proposal rates would go up. They haven't. Proposal rates haven't gone up. No. Rate, not acceptance rates, proposal rates. Proposal rates haven't got. Okay, that's interesting. So we've reverted back to what we were doing before. Four. But proposal rates have not gone back to where they were before. For me, like. Spending, like, 15 minutes looking and going, this is pretty weird. That's like a bruise. And my better conclusion is, why am I realizing this? By trying to fill in some assumptions for Pete. Yeah. This is back to sort of there aren't the right. Sort of real time. I don't mean real time as in like subsecond. I mean as in. Day to day reporting machine machining so that you can see. At a glance. Is everything working properly and not just in sort of the stuff that's. Marked as whip, but the stuff that should be marked as whip or sort of based on flow rates.",

Okay, given it's complicated, what are the set of symbols? Things that we need to be keeping an eye on to make sure the complicated machine is working as. As we think it is. Yeah, I know.

How much more work are we going to push into the. Chat bot hell quickly, I guess. Yeah. And as ever as I started pulling into going to omni number I'm again like, shit, we're just not really. Looking to do the right things. We made this change with. We saw that energy proposal rates had come down, we made this change. Change. It doesn't look like it's going back up, and I. Noticing that because I'm pretty bought in numbers. Repeat energy proposal rates have gone down. We may what? Change. Should we make the other thing right? When we took it up when rev work? Buying products. We changed the blueprint ordering. Yeah. Do not offer energy first because there's no energy. We don't. It. Forgot to change it back. No, I know. And that was one thing we fixed. Yeah, we fixed. Fixed it with the expectation that energy proposal rates would go up. They haven't. Proposal rates haven't gone up. No. Rate, not acceptance rates, proposal rates. Proposal rates haven't got. Okay, that's interesting. So we've reverted back to what we were doing before. Four. But proposal rates have not gone back to where they were before. For me, like. Spending, like, 15 minutes looking and going, this is pretty weird. That's like a bruise. And my better conclusion is, why am I realizing this? By trying to fill in some assumptions for Pete. Yeah. This is back to sort of there aren't the right. Sort of real time. I don't mean real time as in like subsecond. I mean as in. Day to day reporting machine machining so that you can see. At a glance. Is everything working properly and not just in sort of the stuff that's. Marked as whip, but the stuff that should be marked as whip or sort of based on flow rates. Yeah, I think that's, like, as and when Ezra has more time. What Ezra did is he got to the point where he was like, oh, it's really complicated. We haven't. Then to. Okay, given it's complicated, what are the set of symbols? Things that we need to be keeping an eye on to make sure the complicated machine is working as. As we think it is. Yeah, I know. Needing for the imprints of stuff. I'd love to spend time with it, which I think we can do. Okay, well, what are the subsidiary metrics? Might be okay. Seven days after. What percentage of people have got, you know, these different. We just always keep an eye on that, and that number should be quite stable. Here. Kevin. Right. So I. I buried Kevin into B2B process dashboard creating. And forecasting, and I've got a list of reports that I. Wish I had, which is just simple stuff. Simple stuff that you kind of want. Emily to keep an eye on with mso, like which providers have which kind of. Which levels of savings and tariffs have different exception rates. Does it matter what we offer? How do we use a kind of, you know, what are we offering? Fe. Feedback loop to propose what we should be offering differently from a kind of commercial standpoint. Total. Totally blind. How much is the level of saving in energy changing, changing our acceptance. Rates? No idea. Because we've gone from, like, having 126 reward to having. Having a 70 pound reward that we're faking a bit higher with a 100 and something pound direct saving. Saving from a fix. I have no idea whether that's made a difference or not. A difference. And whether if that goes up or down, that's going to make another difference. Yeah, which is why the sooner Kevin can get. Through the backlog, urgent backlog, and get into the sort of. The more sensible forward leaning stuff, the better. Stuff. Yeah, exactly. Okay.",

        "raw_text": "Pete does. It's like. Okay, calibrate it off so that put the nose. That we did in solar in and see what it spits out. A calibrator of February. Put the actual number of switches in February through your assumptions and see does it spit out the line? Because otherwise I have a super sophisticated model that just, like, spits out garbage. 2 yeah. Okay? I can get him back. That bot is going to do all the work, and we don't need more people. We. Just need a better chat bot. Well, I don't really have a sense of how much of the. Work is in WhatsApp. No, I don't have good visibility to any of that, really. The moment. And that's kind of what I'm trying to say. Can we try? Does it make sense? Divide the work into different types, because at the moment, I don't really have an idea. Do. Yes. How much more work are we going to push into the. Chat bot hell quickly, I guess. Yeah. And as ever as I started pulling into going to omni number I'm again like, shit, we're just not really. Looking to do the right things. We made this change with. We saw that energy proposal rates had come down, we made this change. Change. It doesn't look like it's going back up, and I. Noticing that because I'm pretty bought in numbers. Repeat energy proposal rates have gone down. We may what? Change. Should we make the other thing right? When we took it up when rev work? Buying products. We changed the blueprint ordering. Yeah. Do not offer energy first because there's no energy. We don't. It. Forgot to change it back. No, I know. And that was one thing we fixed. Yeah, we fixed. Fixed it with the expectation that energy proposal rates would go up. They haven't. Proposal rates haven't gone up. No. Rate, not acceptance rates, proposal rates. Proposal rates haven't got. Okay, that's interesting. So we've reverted back to what we were doing before. Four. But proposal rates have not gone back to where they were before. For me, like. Spending, like, 15 minutes looking and going, this is pretty weird. That's like a bruise. And my better conclusion is, why am I realizing this? By trying to fill in some assumptions for Pete. Yeah. This is back to sort of there aren't the right. Sort of real time. I don't mean real time as in like subsecond. I mean as in. Day to day reporting machine machining so that you can see. At a glance. Is everything working properly and not just in sort of the stuff that's. Marked as whip, but the stuff that should be marked as whip or sort of based on flow rates. Yeah, I think that's, like, as and when Ezra has more time. What Ezra did is he got to the point where he was like, oh, it's really complicated. We haven't. Then to. Okay, given it's complicated, what are the set of symbols? Things that we need to be keeping an eye on to make sure the complicated machine is working as. As we think it is. Yeah, I know. Needing for the imprints of stuff. I'd love to spend time with it, which I think we can do. Okay, well, what are the subsidiary metrics? Might be okay. Seven days after. What percentage of people have got, you know, these different. We just always keep an eye on that, and that number should be quite stable. Here. Kevin. Right. So I. I buried Kevin into B2B process dashboard creating. And forecasting, and I've got a list of reports that I. Wish I had, which is just simple stuff. Simple stuff that you kind of want. Emily to keep an eye on with mso, like which providers have which kind of. Which levels of savings and tariffs have different exception rates. Does it matter what we offer? How do we use a kind of, you know, what are we offering? Fe. Feedback loop to propose what we should be offering differently from a kind of commercial standpoint. Total. Totally blind. How much is the level of saving in energy changing, changing our acceptance. Rates? No idea. Because we've gone from, like, having 126 reward to having. Having a 70 pound reward that we're faking a bit higher with a 100 and something pound direct saving. Saving from a fix. I have no idea whether that's made a difference or not. A difference. And whether if that goes up or down, that's going to make another difference. Yeah, which is why the sooner Kevin can get. Through the backlog, urgent backlog, and get into the sort of. The more sensible forward leaning stuff, the better. Stuff. Yeah, exactly. Okay. What's happening on? What's happening on? I gave Ezra the what's happening on Reward dist. Dispensation, who is taking out rewards, who's not. And he did some of it, and then he got bet. Buried. And I put that on Kevin's list. But again, he's not going to get to that for a little while. I'll give you another. Other example, Subscriptions. I have a hunch that we'll discuss. Some quite interesting patterns in which people actually hit Subscribe. So I have this sense that because everyone who came. Through B2B had this kind of sold to them as a this is a free. Thing that work's giving you. They will be less likely to subscribe, but also that they'll be less likely. Likely to have withdrawn their reward. But again, Is what's happening with that whole loop. And what, therefore, should we change about. Are messaging at the beginning. That's another thing I'd love to look at, but that one is too early to look at. I know it's too early to look at, but it will be agree we should within the next two months there'll be data there that will. Interesting stuff.",

Okay, that's interesting. So we've reverted back to what we were doing before. Four. But proposal rates have not gone back to where they were before. For me, like.

Yeah, I think that's, like, as and when Ezra has more time. What Ezra did is he got to the point where he was like, oh, it's really complicated. We haven't. Then to. Okay, given it's complicated, what are the set of symbols? Things that we need to be keeping an eye on to make sure the complicated machine is working as. As we think it is. Yeah, I know. Needing for the imprints of stuff. I'd love to spend time with it, which I think we can do. Okay, well, what are the subsidiary metrics? Might be okay. Seven days after. What percentage of people have got, you know, these different. We just always keep an eye on that, and that number should be quite stable. Here. Kevin. Right. So I. I buried Kevin into B2B process dashboard creating. And forecasting, and I've got a list of reports that I. Wish I had, which is just simple stuff. Simple stuff that you kind of want. Emily to keep an eye on with mso, like which providers have which kind of. Which levels of savings and tariffs have different exception rates. Does it matter what we offer? How do we use a kind of, you know, what are we offering? Fe. Feedback loop to propose what we should be offering differently from a kind of commercial standpoint. Total. Totally blind. How much is the level of saving in energy changing, changing our acceptance. Rates? No idea. Because we've gone from, like, having 126 reward to having. Having a 70 pound reward that we're faking a bit higher with a 100 and something pound direct saving. Saving from a fix. I have no idea whether that's made a difference or not. A difference. And whether if that goes up or down, that's going to make another difference. Yeah, which is why the sooner Kevin can get. Through the backlog, urgent backlog, and get into the sort of. The more sensible forward leaning stuff, the better. Stuff. Yeah, exactly. Okay. What's happening on? What's happening on? I gave Ezra the what's happening on Reward dist. Dispensation, who is taking out rewards, who's not. And he did some of it, and then he got bet. Buried. And I put that on Kevin's list. But again, he's not going to get to that for a little while. I'll give you another. Other example, Subscriptions. I have a hunch that we'll discuss. Some quite interesting patterns in which people actually hit Subscribe. So I have this sense that because everyone who came. Through B2B had this kind of sold to them as a this is a free. Thing that work's giving you. They will be less likely to subscribe, but also that they'll be less likely. Likely to have withdrawn their reward. But again, Is what's happening with that whole loop. And what, therefore, should we change about. Are messaging at the beginning. That's another thing I'd love to look at, but that one is too early to look at. I know it's too early to look at, but it will be agree we should within the next two months there'll be data there that will. Interesting stuff. You know, who are. Who are our users? Like we. Know we've got the sort codes of every user and we can split them in game space. Details and how active they've been in the service and who they bank with because I paid so many. Monzo sort codes. I feel like I'm just paying Monzo sort codes all the time. When I was manually doing the payment. Are all our users actually Monzo customers. Is that actually a really key demonstration? Graphic stat. Just feels that way. Love to do the analysis. 4o. Four silk codes. I just felt I was paying the whole time. That's one day. This is what you had yet. Do anything to do it, but let's try and get Kevin. Commercial answers. Yes. Go. Tree right there. John, just. I won't do anything. As the thing unless I hear from you, okay, I. Will tomorrow give you something. Things. Don't. Dave. All right, cool. Cheers. Cheers, guys. Hey. Such a shit chat app. What is it doing my face? Can you see, like, one corner of my face? Yeah. No idea. What? Just move. Up physically. See how it. Cushion slightly to the right. And this is why. Video, that's why. Well, that's. Slightly better. Now you. Now you get a view of my water bottle.

When we took it up when rev work? Buying products. We changed the blueprint ordering. Yeah. Do not offer energy first because there's no energy. We don't. It. Forgot to change it back. No, I know. And that was one thing we fixed. Yeah, we fixed. Fixed it with the expectation that energy proposal rates would go up. They haven't. Proposal rates haven't gone up. No. Rate, not acceptance rates, proposal rates. Proposal rates haven't got. Okay, that's interesting. So we've reverted back to what we were doing before. Four. But proposal rates have not gone back to where they were before. For me, like. Spending, like, 15 minutes looking and going, this is pretty weird. That's like a bruise.

There are the culture wars between the US And Europe. The vice president, J.D. vance, accusing the Europeans of threatening civil liberties. Of over regulating tech companies. There is the war. Of the trade war. Over terrorists. That, yes, have been diminished. But the trade, those tariffs are US Triumphs are still there. So. So now we've got this other front, if you like, on the transatlantic tensions. Over two, even in Israeli politics. Politicians who are considered very much at the extreme. The interesting thing is this, is that even opponents. Within the Israeli political body of Mr. Smotrich and Mr. Ben Gavir have sort of said this is the wrong move by the European. By the British and the Canadians. But the point is, is that the UK and these other governments are under huge political pressure to act. They've been waiting to play this card. They've now decided to play it. The interesting question now is where the debate goes. Already there's discussions about do they get into a place where they recognize the state of Palestinian, Palestinian state. But that's for another day. For another day. And another day we will indeed be getting Palestinians reaction to that. But for now, our diplomatic correspondent, James Landale. Thanks very much. Indeed. And a bit later on in this program. A bit of defeat for Greenland's national football team after they are refused entry to conquer Gaff. It's the body which governs football in North America. We will keep fighting. Like to get recognized. And that's one of our big dream that someday Greenland can play a World cup qualification match. That's the biggest dream of all Greenlanders right now. I have more from Greenland's Harry Kane a bit later on in the program. Now fireworks. Another objects have been thrown at police during a second night of disorder in Ballamina in Northern Ireland. Last night, a peaceful demonstration over the alleged sexual assault of a girl by two teenagers descended into violence and attacks on the houses of migrants. We can speak to our island correspondent, Chris Page. Now, Chris. Bring us up to speed. First of all, in the background. To all of this. And then perhaps tell us what's happening tonight. Yes. Police again are facing a challenging night this evening. In Ballamina in County Antrim around this time. Last night was really when the trouble broke out initially earlier in the evening. There had been a peaceful march near the city center, attended by hundreds of people protesting about an alleged sexual assault in the town at the weekend.",

And another day we will indeed be getting Palestinians reaction to that. But for now, our diplomatic correspondent, James Landale. Thanks very much. Indeed. And a bit later on in this program. A bit of defeat for Greenland's national football team after they are refused entry to conquer Gaff. It's the body which governs football in North America. We will keep fighting. Like to get recognized. And that's one of our big dream that someday Greenland can play a World cup qualification match. That's the biggest dream of all Greenlanders right now. I have more from Greenland's Harry Kane a bit later on in the program. Now fireworks. Another objects have been thrown at police during a second night of disorder in Ballamina in Northern Ireland. Last night, a peaceful demonstration over the alleged sexual assault of a girl by two teenagers descended into violence and attacks on the houses of migrants. We can speak to our island correspondent, Chris Page. Now, Chris. Bring us up to speed. First of all, in the background. To all of this. And then perhaps tell us what's happening tonight. Yes. Police again are facing a challenging night this evening. In Ballamina in County Antrim around this time. Last night was really when the trouble broke out initially earlier in the evening. There had been a peaceful march near the city center, attended by hundreds of people protesting about an alleged sexual assault in the town at the weekend. Earlier yesterday. Two teenage boys had appeared in court, charged with the attempted rip of a teenage girl. They were remanded in custody. And they spoke. Via an interpreter in Romanian to confirm their names in the court, which heard that they would be denying those charges. So that demonstration was peaceful. But police say that a number of youths wearing masks broke off from the demonstration. And then began to attack both police officers and the homes of migrants. And today, about half a dozen migrant families have moved out of their homes as a result of what they suffered. Last night, there were four houses set on fire. Windows were smashed of other houses, doors kicked in, and also a number of businesses damaged. Two police officers suffered injuries, 15 of them. Fortunately, all of the minor. So again tonight, police coming under attack in the same area of ballamina. Yeah. And also spreading out across other parts of Northern Ireland. In anticipation of a repeat of the trouble. Yes. Police said today that they were deploying extra resources, as you say, Jamie, across Northern Ireland. To be ready in case there was an escalation. Of trouble. They did say they had no indication at that stage. This is early this afternoon. That there was going to be more violence. But there has been more trouble.",

        "raw_text": "Yet, as we heard from your interview with Mr. Huckabee and also from the statement from Mr. Rubio, They're just sort of ignoring that subject. And so I think that's the fascinating point about this American response. It's just taking it as some sort of a criticism of Israel generically by these Western allies, which is not what's taking place. What kind of impact, if any, do you think this might have on relations between the UK and the United States? Well, look, it's just another fissure, if you think about it. We've got the U.S. you know, at odds with European allies over defense spending, continually urging the Europeans to do more. They say they're going to do more, but they're being too slow about it. There are the culture wars between the US And Europe. The vice president, J.D. vance, accusing the Europeans of threatening civil liberties. Of over regulating tech companies. There is the war. Of the trade war. Over terrorists. That, yes, have been diminished. But the trade, those tariffs are US Triumphs are still there. So. So now we've got this other front, if you like, on the transatlantic tensions. Over two, even in Israeli politics. Politicians who are considered very much at the extreme. The interesting thing is this, is that even opponents. Within the Israeli political body of Mr. Smotrich and Mr. Ben Gavir have sort of said this is the wrong move by the European. By the British and the Canadians. But the point is, is that the UK and these other governments are under huge political pressure to act. They've been waiting to play this card. They've now decided to play it. The interesting question now is where the debate goes. Already there's discussions about do they get into a place where they recognize the state of Palestinian, Palestinian state. But that's for another day. For another day.
