Now, obviously, some of this won't apply. Why, but yeah. Look, Maria will eventually. Come she'll be living in this all day, every day. Yeah. Even when she is living in it all day, every day. I still think that there's an awful lot that Alex is going to have to. And Beth and you and others in the sales in the. The sort of front facing bit of the Aug are going to have to figure out the kind of the playbook of how to. To how to tease some of these project planning sessions up. How to. Make sure people are. Yeah. Yeah. And I think it's having having spoken to. I spoke to the guy who runs this stuff at Wade street, and. Obviously, we've interviewed a few people about this. I think with very, very large companies, this. My understanding is that this is something that can take. Months to get this running and rolling. And definitely you go here and you try this. This. You go over here and you try that, and then you work out that this person can actually deliver you that. And it's like a kind of. It's not a one shot game in a way that like doing a housing association. I think is making picking that as an example. There are a bunch of housing associ. With 1 to 2000 employees in the UK and if we see another one, I think we just like, try and slam the nhp. G playbook down their throats, because I think we know that that's kind of roughly what works. And there'll be a few local conditions, but I think everyone I've spoken. Everyone I've spoken to about this puzzle has said once the company gets over. Of a certain size, and it depends on your product and what you're trying to do with them. It just becomes. An art form, and it doesn't become like the last one, and it becomes. And it becomes total. Totally dependent on a relationship you didn't know you were going to find with some random person who unlocked someone. Something or whatever. And so you totally keep on working through the organization in order to get that, which I think. Think was slightly what I felt. Sorry I was slow to. Find a way to voice this at the time, but when Michelle kept saying, so what problem are we solving with this? Functionality slightly. I sort of want to kind of think about the way around. You sort of got to jump to. Look, we need a toolbox. We need 10 ways of doing this. They all need to have been plausibly designed, but without a specific client application content. Text in mind so that you can walk into the client and some of them actually work and. Some of them are in building, and some of them are sort of just paper. But you can go in and say, Oh, absolutely. We've got a whole variety of ways of doing this. We've had huge success with this one. Here's one that we've recently tested. Tested and just rolled out and sort of thing. And reality is like you've actually got one last. Half things that really work. But you kind of ready to go and you've got this rolling. Capability. And I think that sort of sense that it's not we. Don't really know whether WhatsApp will be a thing that works or whether people want to do it, but it might. You just got to build some stuff. Exactly. You kind of. And that. That's the dance, right? Is you're sort of going in there, going, who can you. You introduced me to. Which of these 10 things that are on my theoretical list of. Things I could do are applicable. And a lot of the game is just not quite working out on the fly because. Of just trying to match what you're hearing to what kind of is in your imaginary toolbox.

Is invite my local HR team and get them to organize sessions locally. And I don't know if you remember, but most of the Network Rail success was actually, we did sessions with, like, a hundred. Something HR people, and we got, like, half a dozen of them to do it locally and. And actually that I think is a method that might work in bigger companies more. More broadly. Like you get HR champions in, but you're feeling that out because obviously, if. The company is going to give you a centrally organized session. You want to take those? You don't want to lead with that. It's like, okay, you won't give us that this can work, but you actually have to introduce us to all the.",

I still think that there's an awful lot that Alex is going to have to. And Beth and you and others in the sales in the. The sort of front facing bit of the Aug are going to have to figure out the kind of the playbook of how to. To how to tease some of these project planning sessions up. How to. Make sure people are. Yeah. Yeah. And I think it's having having spoken to. I spoke to the guy who runs this stuff at Wade street, and. Obviously, we've interviewed a few people about this. I think with very, very large companies, this. My understanding is that this is something that can take. Months to get this running and rolling. And definitely you go here and you try this. This. You go over here and you try that, and then you work out that this person can actually deliver you that. And it's like a kind of. It's not a one shot game in a way that like doing a housing association. I think is making picking that as an example. There are a bunch of housing associ.

        "raw_text": "way that like doing a housing association. I think is making picking that as an example. There are a bunch of housing associ. With 1 to 2000 employees in the UK and if we see another one, I think we just like, try and slam the nhp. G playbook down their throats, because I think we know that that's kind of roughly what works. And there'll be a few local conditions, but I think everyone I've spoken. Everyone I've spoken to about this puzzle has said once the company gets over. Of a certain size, and it depends on your product and what you're trying to do with them. It just becomes. An art form, and it doesn't become like the last one, and it becomes. And it becomes total. Totally dependent on a relationship you didn't know you were going to find with some random person who unlocked someone. Something or whatever. And so you totally keep on working through the organization in order to get that, which I think. Think was slightly what I felt. Sorry I was slow to. Find a way to voice this at the time, but when Michelle kept saying, so what problem are we solving with this? Functionality slightly. I sort of want to kind of think about the way around. You sort of got to jump to. Look, we need a toolbox. We need 10 ways of doing this. They all need to have been plausibly designed, but without a specific client application content. Text in mind so that you can walk into the client and some of them actually work and. Some of them are in building, and some of them are sort of just paper. But you can go in and say, Oh, absolutely. We've got a whole variety of ways of doing this. We've had huge success with this one. Here's one that we've recently tested. Tested and just rolled out and sort of thing. And reality is like you've actually got one last. Half things that really work. But you kind of ready to go and you've got this rolling. Capability. And I think that sort of sense that it's not we. Don't really know whether WhatsApp will be a thing that works or whether people want to do it, but it might. You just got to build some stuff. Exactly. You kind of. And that. That's the dance, right? Is you're sort of going in there, going, who can you. You introduced me to. Which of these 10 things that are on my theoretical list of. Things I could do are applicable. And a lot of the game is just not quite working out on the fly because. Of just trying to match what you're hearing to what kind of is in your imaginary toolbox. Even though some of it is a known toolbox. Sessions are a known toolbox. We. Know that NHG and NHS professionals have done the two primary models of sessions and made them. Work. And I think we know how to make those work. We just have to replicate those conditions. I. Network rail. I don't think that's a brilliant proxy. For as it's an okay proxy. We've got 800 accounts out of that organization. There are 30 something thousand people. It's. Okay. We didn't have delegation at that point. We did a bunch of stuff. I think it gives us some less. Essence. I think the bit that I think is, sorry, this is an aside, but the bit I think that's really interest. Interesting about what we did at Network Rail is which I don. Don't think we've realized how applicable it is now until we've seen it again. What we did at Network Rail. Is we had a central benefits team who said we can't organize sessions. The best I can do. Is invite my local HR team and get them to organize sessions locally. And I don't know if you remember, but most of the Network Rail success was actually, we did sessions with, like, a hundred. Something HR people, and we got, like, half a dozen of them to do it locally and. And actually that I think is a method that might work in bigger companies more. More broadly. Like you get HR champions in, but you're feeling that out because obviously, if. The company is going to give you a centrally organized session. You want to take those? You don't want to lead with that. It's like, okay, you won't give us that this can work, but you actually have to introduce us to all the. HR people. And then we're not going to convert all of them. We'll convert some of them. That will be enough to get that. Portion of the rollout moving, and then you have to go on the intranet and you have to get some better comms. The. We've got. Anyway, I agree with you these things. I think once you go. Above. I'm picking a number here. 20,000 people. 10,000 people anyway, or whatever that number is. Some. Somewhere in that region. They're all different. Or they're all different until you've done a lot of them. But, yeah, let me figure out what I want to have in my back pocket that isn't just my ability to kind of. Of like, yeah, we've done this, which is kind of what. What you sort of want to start into a certain extent. It's like, oh, you know, you almost don't want to blast them with a presentation. Because then they know all the things that are on your list, and you can't create a new one if there are some other things. Thing. You've already showed them the five things that you do. You can't create the sixth one based on what? They say? Because it's not in your presentation. Yeah. So I guess, was it. It. If it's important, it feels important. So if there is stuff that you want.",

Like you get HR champions in, but you're feeling that out because obviously, if. The company is going to give you a centrally organized session. You want to take those? You don't want to lead with that. It's like, okay, you won't give us that this can work, but you actually have to introduce us to all the. HR people. And then we're not going to convert all of them. We'll convert some of them. That will be enough to get that. Portion of the rollout moving, and then you have to go on the intranet and you have to get some better comms. The. We've got. Anyway, I agree with you these things. I think once you go. Above. I'm picking a number here. 20,000 people. 10,000 people anyway, or whatever that number is. Some. Somewhere in that region. They're all different. Or they're all different until you've done a lot of them. But, yeah, let me figure out what I want to have in my back pocket that isn't just my ability to kind of. Of like, yeah, we've done this, which is kind of what. What you sort of want to start into a certain extent. It's like, oh, you know, you almost don't want to blast them with a presentation. Because then they know all the things that are on your list, and you can't create a new one if there are some other things. Thing. You've already showed them the five things that you do. You can't create the sixth one based on what? They say? Because it's not in your presentation. Yeah. So I guess, was it. It. If it's important, it feels important. So if there is stuff that you want. Want in your back pocket, let me know and I'll try and make it happen. But don't just invest. Don't take for the sake of it. No, but I think it's those things that are on the product. List. I think it's like a little conceptual thing that's almost like a pretend case study. It's like. It's like, hit me. Hey, funny to say that this isn't quite right. Right, but this is kind of something we did, and you've got one slide. It's like, let me pull this up sort of thing. Yeah, that would be helpful. Some. Right. I think, Pop. I think. Sorry. I think part of the reason I want. To be there on Tuesday is that I genuinely think. I genuinely think I'm the best person in the company at that, by some margin. Well, and you have. Yeah, you put.

Is invite my local HR team and get them to organize sessions locally. And I don't know if you remember, but most of the Network Rail success was actually, we did sessions with, like, a hundred. Something HR people, and we got, like, half a dozen of them to do it locally and. And actually that I think is a method that might work in bigger companies more. More broadly.

You don't want to lead with that. It's like, okay, you won't give us that this can work, but you actually have to introduce us to all the. HR people. And then we're not going to convert all of them. We'll convert some of them. That will be enough to get that. Portion of the rollout moving, and then you have to go on the intranet and you have to get some better comms. The. We've got. Anyway, I agree with you these things. I think once you go. Above. I'm picking a number here. 20,000 people. 10,000 people anyway, or whatever that number is. Some. Somewhere in that region. They're all different. Or they're all different until you've done a lot of them. But, yeah, let me figure out what I want to have in my back pocket that isn't just my ability to kind of. Of like, yeah, we've done this, which is kind of what. What you sort of want to start into a certain extent. It's like, oh, you know, you almost don't want to blast them with a presentation. Because then they know all the things that are on your list, and you can't create a new one if there are some other things. Thing. You've already showed them the five things that you do. You can't create the sixth one based on what? They say? Because it's not in your presentation. Yeah. So I guess, was it. It. If it's important, it feels important. So if there is stuff that you want. Want in your back pocket, let me know and I'll try and make it happen. But don't just invest. Don't take for the sake of it. No, but I think it's those things that are on the product. List. I think it's like a little conceptual thing that's almost like a pretend case study. It's like. It's like, hit me. Hey, funny to say that this isn't quite right. Right, but this is kind of something we did, and you've got one slide. It's like, let me pull this up sort of thing. Yeah, that would be helpful. Some. Right. I think, Pop. I think. Sorry. I think part of the reason I want. To be there on Tuesday is that I genuinely think. I genuinely think I'm the best person in the company at that, by some margin. Well, and you have. Yeah, you put. You probably are. You also have context, John. Yes. Yes. I have context on that organization. I have context and I have context. On retail organizations. I think you'll be able to push them much higher. Harder than. Because you can say, here's what worked at Sainsbury's. You can come at them a bit. It in a way that it would be very hard for anyone else to. And know how hard you can push. But I think you will have to push hard whether it's not and it's not just on. On Tuesday. Over the course of the next three to six months, it's going to be. A sort of an ongoing, you know. Yeah, I think everything that.

You're in the trenches for a while, getting whatever works in the real big company to work. That's what we had to do with network rail. It took us a while in network rail to actually figure network rail out, and. We sort of figured it out, but we didn't codify it because we thought Network Rail was the weirdest company we'd ever seen. Seen. But actually, I think more of it is more applicable to these large organizations than we really. Realized at the time. I think we put it all down to, oh, they're this weird conglomerate of companies. Where no one centrally can actually ask anybody to do anything. And I think we've just. Seen that in Live Nation. They're like lots of devolved companies that come together into one. Company, and what we should have done is pulled out the devolved company playbook, which we've actually. Built for network rep. But we didn't know that was a playbook. We just thought that was a weird thing about network rep. Being this weird multi organization organization with no central. Coordination. No central power and lots of local power, but actually, there's probably more of those than we think. Think is my guess. We've now seen another one, which is interesting. Then the question become. How do you triage those earlier so you end up in the right box? It's like. Okay, we're building an implementation plan with you. We need to sign up implementation plan what is possible. Okay, These things aren't possible. These things are possible. Here's what I. Need you to agree to do before we start. Okay. I need to almost put you down a flow diagram that ends up.

But actually, I think more of it is more applicable to these large organizations than we really. Realized at the time. I think we put it all down to, oh, they're this weird conglomerate of companies. Where no one centrally can actually ask anybody to do anything. And I think we've just. Seen that in Live Nation. They're like lots of devolved companies that come together into one. Company, and what we should have done is pulled out the devolved company playbook, which we've actually. Built for network rep. But we didn't know that was a playbook. We just thought that was a weird thing about network rep. Being this weird multi organization organization with no central. Coordination. No central power and lots of local power, but actually, there's probably more of those than we think. Think is my guess. We've now seen another one, which is interesting. Then the question become. How do you triage those earlier so you end up in the right box? It's like. Okay, we're building an implementation plan with you. We need to sign up implementation plan what is possible. Okay, These things aren't possible. These things are possible. Here's what I. Need you to agree to do before we start. Okay. I need to almost put you down a flow diagram that ends up. With, like, can you organize sessions? No. Okay, you've got two options. You can either give us each end. Hrbp or you can fuck off kind of thing. That challenge with it, okay? Things you end up doing that you didn't think you'd end up doing, you'd asked me four years ago. You're going to be like, Doing B2B rollout planning. I would have been. No, we will be on Facebook. And working with influencers. We are. Persistent. We are, we are and. And I'm sort of, you know, as far. Too early to declare victory, but I have sort of. A growing understanding of what is realistic and. And I think. I think we. I think there is a world in which we could drive the better part of 100 delegations a day without. Actually adding resource per workday. I think to achieve that, we both have to get. We have to get more insight. Than we are at the moment. And I think we also have to get a bit smarter than we are at the moment. And the process has to be slicker and more supported. But I don't think it's impossible. Completely impossible, at least. These, so. Yeah, I think there's just a lot of sort of prel. Preliminary work that has to happen, and some of it.",

But actually, I think more of it is more applicable to these large organizations than we really. Realized at the time. I think we put it all down to, oh, they're this weird conglomerate of companies. Where no one centrally can actually ask anybody to do anything. And I think we've just. Seen that in Live Nation. They're like lots of devolved companies that come together into one. Company, and what we should have done is pulled out the devolved company playbook, which we've actually. Built for network rep. But we didn't know that was a playbook. We just thought that was a weird thing about network rep. Being this weird multi organization organization with no central. Coordination. No central power and lots of local power, but actually, there's probably more of those than we think. Think is my guess. We've now seen another one, which is interesting. Then the question become.

A growing understanding of what is realistic and. And I think. I think we. I think there is a world in which we could drive the better part of 100 delegations a day without. Actually adding resource per workday. I think to achieve that, we both have to get. We have to get more insight. Than we are at the moment. And I think we also have to get a bit smarter than we are at the moment. And the process has to be slicker and more supported. But I don't think it's impossible. Completely impossible, at least.

But actually, I think more of it is more applicable to these large organizations than we really. Realized at the time. I think we put it all down to, oh, they're this weird conglomerate of companies. Where no one centrally can actually ask anybody to do anything. And I think we've just. Seen that in Live Nation. They're like lots of devolved companies that come together into one. Company, and what we should have done is pulled out the devolved company playbook, which we've actually. Built for network rep. But we didn't know that was a playbook. We just thought that was a weird thing about network rep. Being this weird multi organization organization with no central. Coordination. No central power and lots of local power, but actually, there's probably more of those than we think. Think is my guess. We've now seen another one, which is interesting. Then the question become. How do you triage those earlier so you end up in the right box? It's like. Okay, we're building an implementation plan with you. We need to sign up implementation plan what is possible. Okay, These things aren't possible. These things are possible. Here's what I. Need you to agree to do before we start. Okay. I need to almost put you down a flow diagram that ends up. With, like, can you organize sessions? No. Okay, you've got two options. You can either give us each end. Hrbp or you can fuck off kind of thing. That challenge with it, okay? Things you end up doing that you didn't think you'd end up doing, you'd asked me four years ago. You're going to be like, Doing B2B rollout planning. I would have been. No, we will be on Facebook. And working with influencers. We are. Persistent. We are, we are and. And I'm sort of, you know, as far. Too early to declare victory, but I have sort of. A growing understanding of what is realistic and. And I think. I think we. I think there is a world in which we could drive the better part of 100 delegations a day without. Actually adding resource per workday. I think to achieve that, we both have to get. We have to get more insight. Than we are at the moment. And I think we also have to get a bit smarter than we are at the moment. And the process has to be slicker and more supported. But I don't think it's impossible. Completely impossible, at least. These, so. Yeah, I think there's just a lot of sort of prel. Preliminary work that has to happen, and some of it. Has happened, and some of it we're doing now. Groan. Have you had a chance to spend much time with Pete? Yes. Today. And today I have spent some time. With Pete. It's getting him going in the right direction. We're in the face.

Do you have versus what top line is going to be versus how much you automate things, how. And I'm trying to make sure we get the right. Balance of moral that's useful versus. Is great. We're going to spend two weeks building a model and actually no time to actually. Talk about what it says. I'm checking in with him again tomorrow. I'm helping, trying to get some of the assumptions. And stuff that he needs to make it work. He hopes that. By emulator. Today he's got something that we can start actually talking about. What does it say? What does it imply about that? I haven't got anything yet on Top line assumptions. I think I'm going to start by making something. Up and then ask. Kevin to help me fill in the gaps of. Yeah, there is a thing emerging. It starts. Honest, I don't think either them is quite forced. I think either of them has sort of been. Had a gun to their head. Say, I need something by the end of. The day today, and you would get something. You'd get something quite quickly. It might not be. It might not be very refined. What kind of timeline do they think? As in, I can even make six?",

And I'm sort of, you know, as far. Too early to declare victory, but I have sort of. A growing understanding of what is realistic and. And I think. I think we. I think there is a world in which we could drive the better part of 100 delegations a day without. Actually adding resource per workday. I think to achieve that, we both have to get. We have to get more insight. Than we are at the moment. And I think we also have to get a bit smarter than we are at the moment. And the process has to be slicker and more supported. But I don't think it's impossible. Completely impossible, at least. These, so. Yeah, I think there's just a lot of sort of prel. Preliminary work that has to happen, and some of it. Has happened, and some of it we're doing now. Groan. Have you had a chance to spend much time with Pete? Yes. Today. And today I have spent some time. With Pete. It's getting him going in the right direction. We're in the face. Phase of we haven't yet got to the phase of being able to talk about training. Jobs. We're still in the phase of building a model and. And trade off sorry for my education. Unlike how many people?

We're going to spend two weeks building a model and actually no time to actually. Talk about what it says. I'm checking in with him again tomorrow. I'm helping, trying to get some of the assumptions. And stuff that he needs to make it work. He hopes that. By emulator. Today he's got something that we can start actually talking about. What does it say? What does it imply about that? I haven't got anything yet on Top line assumptions. I think I'm going to start by making something. Up and then ask. Kevin to help me fill in the gaps of. Yeah, there is a thing emerging. It starts. Honest, I don't think either them is quite forced. I think either of them has sort of been. Had a gun to their head. Say, I need something by the end of. The day today, and you would get something. You'd get something quite quickly. It might not be. It might not be very refined. What kind of timeline do they think? As in, I can even make six? Or 12 months out. I think he's much more focused in next two months kind of thing. I. I normally place to work. No, what Kevin's working on. Is a short to medium term thingy and he's going to be using the. He'll be using notion for that, but he's also started thinking about. Out what the sort of forecast. Machinery might need to look like as well that to feed into. Reforecasting, is it? Exactly. For what said's called six plus. Six, I think. Why is it called six plus six? I don't know. Because. Said French? No, that's how big companies do. Forecast fore. There we go. Six months. That's what they call it. Twelve. No, because it's the one, that midget it comes from. Just so you know, because this is what big companies do, and I lived in this world. Right. So you have a fine that. Team, and they talk about these in their big deals, and it's like six months. Real six month forecast. You sometimes do a three plus nine and you do a nine plus three. Of things are miles off. And it's just the way big companies talk about how they do their forecasting. They talk about. Of real and months of forecast as you go midway through the year. Is it worth doing a nine plus three? Yeah. Things are miles off. Let's do a nine plus three this year. Didn't do one last year. You'd get that in Sainsbury's and ensure. Shop there. He's using standard Big Co language, probably because it's a McKinsey thing. McKinsey probably taught it to half the companies in the Footsie. 100 exactly. And. Solve it each time for a million bucks a pop, right? Exactly. So. I think whatever it's called, it's a view to the end of the year, and we said we were going to. Reforecast because we knew we didn't know what we were doing at the beginning of the year, so fair enough. The bits that I'm. So you have. You'll have. Something, Glenn. Quite soon. But not tomorrow. You'll have something by the end of this week or. Certainly by the end of next week, but it's then going to need to go through a couple of cycles. Before and challenge sessions, that's fine. We just need to start. We're not trying to come up with an answer by the end of this week. We need to get to the point where we can actually have a start to have this interval conversation of. Okay, Right. If we're going to have this kind of top line, do we actually. Actually believe that? Because if we actually believe that, that implies that I need to go do priority people. Should I go and hire people based off this plan or do we actually want to be more research that kind of gone the same? Station the competition to get to or. Hey, I need to be actually.",

That's what they call it. Twelve. No, because it's the one, that midget it comes from. Just so you know, because this is what big companies do, and I lived in this world. Right. So you have a fine that. Team, and they talk about these in their big deals, and it's like six months. Real six month forecast. You sometimes do a three plus nine and you do a nine plus three. Of things are miles off. And it's just the way big companies talk about how they do their forecasting. They talk about. Of real and months of forecast as you go midway through the year. Is it worth doing a nine plus three? Yeah. Things are miles off. Let's do a nine plus three this year. Didn't do one last year. You'd get that in Sainsbury's and ensure. Shop there. He's using standard Big Co language, probably because it's a McKinsey thing. McKinsey probably taught it to half the companies in the Footsie. 100 exactly. And. Solve it each time for a million bucks a pop, right? Exactly. So. I think whatever it's called, it's a view to the end of the year, and we said we were going to. Reforecast because we knew we didn't know what we were doing at the beginning of the year, so fair enough. The bits that I'm. So you have. You'll have. Something, Glenn. Quite soon. But not tomorrow. You'll have something by the end of this week or. Certainly by the end of next week, but it's then going to need to go through a couple of cycles. Before and challenge sessions, that's fine. We just need to start. We're not trying to come up with an answer by the end of this week. We need to get to the point where we can actually have a start to have this interval conversation of. Okay, Right. If we're going to have this kind of top line, do we actually. Actually believe that? Because if we actually believe that, that implies that I need to go do priority people. Should I go and hire people based off this plan or do we actually want to be more research that kind of gone the same? Station the competition to get to or. Hey, I need to be actually. Using half the engineering team to make this automation here because otherwise I would have to hire 20. Thousand people. Boom. Perfect. Yeah. The hard bit, I think, by the way, is not going to be what's the forecast? I think. It's going to be that what Claire would like them to do is to hire three more people. All, and I don't think they should, but anyway. You know, jumping forward a bit. Are we back in that debate of humans versus. Effort on automation. We're back in time to get to that debate. We haven't had that debate ages, and it's just kind of we've got lucky because we kind of. Missed the top one forecast, so we've been able to get away with not having the delay. And if we. You haven't missed this appointment with a big. Fuck, yeah. Well, there's a silver lining on a shit black pound. Yeah. Every enormous turd has a silver lining.",

We're going to spend two weeks building a model and actually no time to actually. Talk about what it says. I'm checking in with him again tomorrow. I'm helping, trying to get some of the assumptions. And stuff that he needs to make it work. He hopes that. By emulator. Today he's got something that we can start actually talking about. What does it say? What does it imply about that? I haven't got anything yet on Top line assumptions. I think I'm going to start by making something. Up and then ask. Kevin to help me fill in the gaps of. Yeah, there is a thing emerging. It starts. Honest, I don't think either them is quite forced. I think either of them has sort of been. Had a gun to their head. Say, I need something by the end of. The day today, and you would get something. You'd get something quite quickly. It might not be. It might not be very refined. What kind of timeline do they think? As in, I can even make six? Or 12 months out. I think he's much more focused in next two months kind of thing. I. I normally place to work. No, what Kevin's working on. Is a short to medium term thingy and he's going to be using the. He'll be using notion for that, but he's also started thinking about. Out what the sort of forecast. Machinery might need to look like as well that to feed into. Reforecasting, is it? Exactly. For what said's called six plus. Six, I think. Why is it called six plus six? I don't know. Because. Said French? No, that's how big companies do. Forecast fore. There we go. Six months. That's what they call it. Twelve. No, because it's the one, that midget it comes from. Just so you know, because this is what big companies do, and I lived in this world. Right. So you have a fine that. Team, and they talk about these in their big deals, and it's like six months. Real six month forecast. You sometimes do a three plus nine and you do a nine plus three. Of things are miles off. And it's just the way big companies talk about how they do their forecasting. They talk about. Of real and months of forecast as you go midway through the year. Is it worth doing a nine plus three? Yeah. Things are miles off. Let's do a nine plus three this year. Didn't do one last year. You'd get that in Sainsbury's and ensure. Shop there. He's using standard Big Co language, probably because it's a McKinsey thing. McKinsey probably taught it to half the companies in the Footsie. 100 exactly. And. Solve it each time for a million bucks a pop, right? Exactly. So. I think whatever it's called, it's a view to the end of the year, and we said we were going to. Reforecast because we knew we didn't know what we were doing at the beginning of the year, so fair enough. The bits that I'm. So you have. You'll have. Something, Glenn. Quite soon. But not tomorrow. You'll have something by the end of this week or. Certainly by the end of next week, but it's then going to need to go through a couple of cycles. Before and challenge sessions, that's fine. We just need to start. We're not trying to come up with an answer by the end of this week. We need to get to the point where we can actually have a start to have this interval conversation of. Okay, Right. If we're going to have this kind of top line, do we actually. Actually believe that? Because if we actually believe that, that implies that I need to go do priority people. Should I go and hire people based off this plan or do we actually want to be more research that kind of gone the same? Station the competition to get to or. Hey, I need to be actually. Using half the engineering team to make this automation here because otherwise I would have to hire 20. Thousand people. Boom. Perfect. Yeah. The hard bit, I think, by the way, is not going to be what's the forecast? I think. It's going to be that what Claire would like them to do is to hire three more people. All, and I don't think they should, but anyway. You know, jumping forward a bit. Are we back in that debate of humans versus. Effort on automation. We're back in time to get to that debate. We haven't had that debate ages, and it's just kind of we've got lucky because we kind of. Missed the top one forecast, so we've been able to get away with not having the delay. And if we. You haven't missed this appointment with a big. Fuck, yeah. Well, there's a silver lining on a shit black pound. Yeah. Every enormous turd has a silver lining. Thanks for singing. Positive. Back.

As in, I can even make six? Or 12 months out. I think he's much more focused in next two months kind of thing. I. I normally place to work. No, what Kevin's working on. Is a short to medium term thingy and he's going to be using the. He'll be using notion for that, but he's also started thinking about. Out what the sort of forecast. Machinery might need to look like as well that to feed into. Reforecasting, is it? Exactly. For what said's called six plus. Six, I think. Why is it called six plus six? I don't know. Because. Said French? No, that's how big companies do. Forecast fore. There we go. Six months. That's what they call it. Twelve. No, because it's the one, that midget it comes from. Just so you know, because this is what big companies do, and I lived in this world. Right. So you have a fine that. Team, and they talk about these in their big deals, and it's like six months. Real six month forecast. You sometimes do a three plus nine and you do a nine plus three. Of things are miles off. And it's just the way big companies talk about how they do their forecasting. They talk about. Of real and months of forecast as you go midway through the year. Is it worth doing a nine plus three? Yeah. Things are miles off. Let's do a nine plus three this year. Didn't do one last year. You'd get that in Sainsbury's and ensure. Shop there. He's using standard Big Co language, probably because it's a McKinsey thing. McKinsey probably taught it to half the companies in the Footsie. 100 exactly. And. Solve it each time for a million bucks a pop, right? Exactly. So. I think whatever it's called, it's a view to the end of the year, and we said we were going to. Reforecast because we knew we didn't know what we were doing at the beginning of the year, so fair enough. The bits that I'm. So you have. You'll have. Something, Glenn. Quite soon. But not tomorrow. You'll have something by the end of this week or. Certainly by the end of next week, but it's then going to need to go through a couple of cycles. Before and challenge sessions, that's fine. We just need to start. We're not trying to come up with an answer by the end of this week. We need to get to the point where we can actually have a start to have this interval conversation of. Okay, Right. If we're going to have this kind of top line, do we actually. Actually believe that? Because if we actually believe that, that implies that I need to go do priority people. Should I go and hire people based off this plan or do we actually want to be more research that kind of gone the same? Station the competition to get to or. Hey, I need to be actually. Using half the engineering team to make this automation here because otherwise I would have to hire 20. Thousand people. Boom. Perfect. Yeah. The hard bit, I think, by the way, is not going to be what's the forecast? I think. It's going to be that what Claire would like them to do is to hire three more people. All, and I don't think they should, but anyway. You know, jumping forward a bit. Are we back in that debate of humans versus. Effort on automation. We're back in time to get to that debate. We haven't had that debate ages, and it's just kind of we've got lucky because we kind of. Missed the top one forecast, so we've been able to get away with not having the delay. And if we. You haven't missed this appointment with a big. Fuck, yeah. Well, there's a silver lining on a shit black pound. Yeah. Every enormous turd has a silver lining. Thanks for singing. Positive. Back. At the same time, it had been like. Car crash and. Yeah, I'm. I'm pushing that. Yeah, I'm pushing that. Out. We haven't got to the important bit yet, which is actually making. The conversations happen. The model isn't there yet, and as. So it's a bit tricky to figure out exactly what point of arity to do the model that has the right. Level of sophistication, but you can actually run some simple scenarios off. And, yeah, the other thing is, I actually. It all comes down to actually, how you calibrate it is the truth, right? That's what. Just make sure Pete does. It's like. Okay, calibrate it off so that put the nose. That we did in solar in and see what it spits out. A calibrator of February. Put the actual number of switches in February through your assumptions and see does it spit out the line? Because otherwise I have a super sophisticated model that just, like, spits out garbage. 2 yeah. Okay? I can get him back. That bot is going to do all the work, and we don't need more people. We. Just need a better chat bot. Well, I don't really have a sense of how much of the. Work is in WhatsApp. No, I don't have good visibility to any of that, really. The moment. And that's kind of what I'm trying to say. Can we try? Does it make sense? Divide the work into different types, because at the moment, I don't really have an idea. Do. Yes. How much more work are we going to push into the. Chat bot hell quickly, I guess. Yeah. And as ever as I started pulling into going to omni number I'm again like, shit, we're just not really.",

We haven't had that debate ages, and it's just kind of we've got lucky because we kind of. Missed the top one forecast, so we've been able to get away with not having the delay. And if we. You haven't missed this appointment with a big. Fuck, yeah. Well, there's a silver lining on a shit black pound. Yeah. Every enormous turd has a silver lining. Thanks for singing. Positive. Back. At the same time, it had been like. Car crash and. Yeah, I'm. I'm pushing that. Yeah, I'm pushing that. Out. We haven't got to the important bit yet, which is actually making. The conversations happen. The model isn't there yet, and as. So it's a bit tricky to figure out exactly what point of arity to do the model that has the right. Level of sophistication, but you can actually run some simple scenarios off. And, yeah, the other thing is, I actually. It all comes down to actually, how you calibrate it is the truth, right? That's what. Just make sure Pete does. It's like. Okay, calibrate it off so that put the nose. That we did in solar in and see what it spits out. A calibrator of February. Put the actual number of switches in February through your assumptions and see does it spit out the line? Because otherwise I have a super sophisticated model that just, like, spits out garbage. 2 yeah. Okay? I can get him back. That bot is going to do all the work, and we don't need more people. We. Just need a better chat bot. Well, I don't really have a sense of how much of the. Work is in WhatsApp. No, I don't have good visibility to any of that, really. The moment. And that's kind of what I'm trying to say. Can we try? Does it make sense? Divide the work into different types, because at the moment, I don't really have an idea. Do. Yes. How much more work are we going to push into the. Chat bot hell quickly, I guess. Yeah. And as ever as I started pulling into going to omni number I'm again like, shit, we're just not really. Looking to do the right things. We made this change with. We saw that energy proposal rates had come down, we made this change. Change. It doesn't look like it's going back up, and I. Noticing that because I'm pretty bought in numbers. Repeat energy proposal rates have gone down. We may what? Change. Should we make the other thing right? When we took it up when rev work? Buying products. We changed the blueprint ordering. Yeah. Do not offer energy first because there's no energy. We don't. It. Forgot to change it back. No, I know. And that was one thing we fixed. Yeah, we fixed. Fixed it with the expectation that energy proposal rates would go up. They haven't. Proposal rates haven't gone up. No. Rate, not acceptance rates, proposal rates. Proposal rates haven't got. Okay, that's interesting. So we've reverted back to what we were doing before. Four. But proposal rates have not gone back to where they were before. For me, like.

You haven't missed this appointment with a big. Fuck, yeah. Well, there's a silver lining on a shit black pound. Yeah. Every enormous turd has a silver lining. Thanks for singing. Positive. Back. At the same time, it had been like. Car crash and. Yeah, I'm. I'm pushing that. Yeah, I'm pushing that. Out. We haven't got to the important bit yet, which is actually making. The conversations happen. The model isn't there yet, and as. So it's a bit tricky to figure out exactly what point of arity to do the model that has the right. Level of sophistication, but you can actually run some simple scenarios off. And, yeah, the other thing is, I actually. It all comes down to actually, how you calibrate it is the truth, right? That's what. Just make sure Pete does. It's like. Okay, calibrate it off so that put the nose. That we did in solar in and see what it spits out. A calibrator of February. Put the actual number of switches in February through your assumptions and see does it spit out the line? Because otherwise I have a super sophisticated model that just, like, spits out garbage. 2 yeah. Okay? I can get him back. That bot is going to do all the work, and we don't need more people. We. Just need a better chat bot. Well, I don't really have a sense of how much of the. Work is in WhatsApp. No, I don't have good visibility to any of that, really. The moment. And that's kind of what I'm trying to say. Can we try? Does it make sense? Divide the work into different types, because at the moment, I don't really have an idea. Do. Yes. How much more work are we going to push into the. Chat bot hell quickly, I guess. Yeah. And as ever as I started pulling into going to omni number I'm again like, shit, we're just not really. Looking to do the right things. We made this change with. We saw that energy proposal rates had come down, we made this change. Change. It doesn't look like it's going back up, and I. Noticing that because I'm pretty bought in numbers. Repeat energy proposal rates have gone down. We may what? Change. Should we make the other thing right? When we took it up when rev work? Buying products. We changed the blueprint ordering. Yeah. Do not offer energy first because there's no energy. We don't. It. Forgot to change it back. No, I know. And that was one thing we fixed. Yeah, we fixed. Fixed it with the expectation that energy proposal rates would go up. They haven't. Proposal rates haven't gone up. No. Rate, not acceptance rates, proposal rates. Proposal rates haven't got. Okay, that's interesting. So we've reverted back to what we were doing before. Four. But proposal rates have not gone back to where they were before. For me, like. Spending, like, 15 minutes looking and going, this is pretty weird. That's like a bruise. And my better conclusion is, why am I realizing this? By trying to fill in some assumptions for Pete. Yeah. This is back to sort of there aren't the right. Sort of real time. I don't mean real time as in like subsecond. I mean as in. Day to day reporting machine machining so that you can see. At a glance. Is everything working properly and not just in sort of the stuff that's. Marked as whip, but the stuff that should be marked as whip or sort of based on flow rates. Yeah, I think that's, like, as and when Ezra has more time. What Ezra did is he got to the point where he was like, oh, it's really complicated. We haven't. Then to. Okay, given it's complicated, what are the set of symbols? Things that we need to be keeping an eye on to make sure the complicated machine is working as. As we think it is. Yeah, I know. Needing for the imprints of stuff. I'd love to spend time with it, which I think we can do. Okay, well, what are the subsidiary metrics? Might be okay. Seven days after. What percentage of people have got, you know, these different. We just always keep an eye on that, and that number should be quite stable. Here. Kevin. Right. So I. I buried Kevin into B2B process dashboard creating. And forecasting, and I've got a list of reports that I. Wish I had, which is just simple stuff. Simple stuff that you kind of want. Emily to keep an eye on with mso, like which providers have which kind of. Which levels of savings and tariffs have different exception rates. Does it matter what we offer? How do we use a kind of, you know, what are we offering? Fe. Feedback loop to propose what we should be offering differently from a kind of commercial standpoint. Total. Totally blind. How much is the level of saving in energy changing, changing our acceptance. Rates? No idea. Because we've gone from, like, having 126 reward to having. Having a 70 pound reward that we're faking a bit higher with a 100 and something pound direct saving. Saving from a fix. I have no idea whether that's made a difference or not. A difference. And whether if that goes up or down, that's going to make another difference. Yeah, which is why the sooner Kevin can get. Through the backlog, urgent backlog, and get into the sort of.

Yeah, I think that's, like, as and when Ezra has more time. What Ezra did is he got to the point where he was like, oh, it's really complicated. We haven't. Then to. Okay, given it's complicated, what are the set of symbols? Things that we need to be keeping an eye on to make sure the complicated machine is working as. As we think it is. Yeah, I know. Needing for the imprints of stuff. I'd love to spend time with it, which I think we can do. Okay, well, what are the subsidiary metrics? Might be okay. Seven days after. What percentage of people have got, you know, these different. We just always keep an eye on that, and that number should be quite stable. Here. Kevin. Right. So I. I buried Kevin into B2B process dashboard creating. And forecasting, and I've got a list of reports that I. Wish I had, which is just simple stuff. Simple stuff that you kind of want. Emily to keep an eye on with mso, like which providers have which kind of. Which levels of savings and tariffs have different exception rates. Does it matter what we offer? How do we use a kind of, you know, what are we offering? Fe. Feedback loop to propose what we should be offering differently from a kind of commercial standpoint. Total. Totally blind. How much is the level of saving in energy changing, changing our acceptance. Rates? No idea. Because we've gone from, like, having 126 reward to having. Having a 70 pound reward that we're faking a bit higher with a 100 and something pound direct saving. Saving from a fix. I have no idea whether that's made a difference or not. A difference. And whether if that goes up or down, that's going to make another difference. Yeah, which is why the sooner Kevin can get. Through the backlog, urgent backlog, and get into the sort of. The more sensible forward leaning stuff, the better. Stuff. Yeah, exactly. Okay. What's happening on? What's happening on? I gave Ezra the what's happening on Reward dist. Dispensation, who is taking out rewards, who's not. And he did some of it, and then he got bet. Buried. And I put that on Kevin's list. But again, he's not going to get to that for a little while. I'll give you another. Other example, Subscriptions. I have a hunch that we'll discuss. Some quite interesting patterns in which people actually hit Subscribe. So I have this sense that because everyone who came. Through B2B had this kind of sold to them as a this is a free. Thing that work's giving you. They will be less likely to subscribe, but also that they'll be less likely. Likely to have withdrawn their reward. But again, Is what's happening with that whole loop. And what, therefore, should we change about. Are messaging at the beginning. That's another thing I'd love to look at, but that one is too early to look at. I know it's too early to look at, but it will be agree we should within the next two months there'll be data there that will. Interesting stuff.",

We saw that energy proposal rates had come down, we made this change. Change. It doesn't look like it's going back up, and I. Noticing that because I'm pretty bought in numbers. Repeat energy proposal rates have gone down. We may what? Change. Should we make the other thing right? When we took it up when rev work? Buying products. We changed the blueprint ordering. Yeah. Do not offer energy first because there's no energy. We don't. It. Forgot to change it back. No, I know. And that was one thing we fixed. Yeah, we fixed. Fixed it with the expectation that energy proposal rates would go up. They haven't. Proposal rates haven't gone up. No. Rate, not acceptance rates, proposal rates. Proposal rates haven't got. Okay, that's interesting. So we've reverted back to what we were doing before. Four. But proposal rates have not gone back to where they were before. For me, like. Spending, like, 15 minutes looking and going, this is pretty weird. That's like a bruise. And my better conclusion is, why am I realizing this? By trying to fill in some assumptions for Pete. Yeah. This is back to sort of there aren't the right. Sort of real time. I don't mean real time as in like subsecond. I mean as in. Day to day reporting machine machining so that you can see. At a glance. Is everything working properly and not just in sort of the stuff that's. Marked as whip, but the stuff that should be marked as whip or sort of based on flow rates. Yeah, I think that's, like, as and when Ezra has more time. What Ezra did is he got to the point where he was like, oh, it's really complicated. We haven't. Then to. Okay, given it's complicated, what are the set of symbols? Things that we need to be keeping an eye on to make sure the complicated machine is working as. As we think it is. Yeah, I know.

I buried Kevin into B2B process dashboard creating. And forecasting, and I've got a list of reports that I. Wish I had, which is just simple stuff. Simple stuff that you kind of want. Emily to keep an eye on with mso, like which providers have which kind of. Which levels of savings and tariffs have different exception rates. Does it matter what we offer? How do we use a kind of, you know, what are we offering? Fe. Feedback loop to propose what we should be offering differently from a kind of commercial standpoint. Total. Totally blind. How much is the level of saving in energy changing, changing our acceptance. Rates? No idea. Because we've gone from, like, having 126 reward to having. Having a 70 pound reward that we're faking a bit higher with a 100 and something pound direct saving. Saving from a fix. I have no idea whether that's made a difference or not. A difference. And whether if that goes up or down, that's going to make another difference. Yeah, which is why the sooner Kevin can get. Through the backlog, urgent backlog, and get into the sort of. The more sensible forward leaning stuff, the better. Stuff. Yeah, exactly. Okay. What's happening on? What's happening on? I gave Ezra the what's happening on Reward dist.

They will be less likely to subscribe, but also that they'll be less likely. Likely to have withdrawn their reward. But again, Is what's happening with that whole loop.

        "raw_text": "and I. Noticing that because I'm pretty bought in numbers. Repeat energy proposal rates have gone down. We may what? Change. Should we make the other thing right? When we took it up when rev work? Buying products. We changed the blueprint ordering. Yeah. Do not offer energy first because there's no energy. We don't. It. Forgot to change it back. No, I know. And that was one thing we fixed. Yeah, we fixed. Fixed it with the expectation that energy proposal rates would go up. They haven't. Proposal rates haven't gone up. No. Rate, not acceptance rates, proposal rates. Proposal rates haven't got. Okay, that's interesting. So we've reverted back to what we were doing before. Four. But proposal rates have not gone back to where they were before. For me, like. Spending, like, 15 minutes looking and going, this is pretty weird. That's like a bruise. And my better conclusion is, why am I realizing this? By trying to fill in some assumptions for Pete. Yeah. This is back to sort of there aren't the right. Sort of real time. I don't mean real time as in like subsecond. I mean as in. Day to day reporting machine machining so that you can see. At a glance. Is everything working properly and not just in sort of the stuff that's. Marked as whip, but the stuff that should be marked as whip or sort of based on flow rates. Yeah, I think that's, like, as and when Ezra has more time. What Ezra did is he got to the point where he was like, oh, it's really complicated. We haven't. Then to. Okay, given it's complicated, what are the set of symbols? Things that we need to be keeping an eye on to make sure the complicated machine is working as. As we think it is. Yeah, I know. Needing for the imprints of stuff. I'd love to spend time with it, which I think we can do. Okay, well, what are the subsidiary metrics? Might be okay. Seven days after. What percentage of people have got, you know, these different. We just always keep an eye on that, and that number should be quite stable. Here. Kevin. Right. So I. I buried Kevin into B2B process dashboard creating. And forecasting, and I've got a list of reports that I. Wish I had, which is just simple stuff. Simple stuff that you kind of want. Emily to keep an eye on with mso, like which providers have which kind of. Which levels of savings and tariffs have different exception rates. Does it matter what we offer? How do we use a kind of, you know, what are we offering? Fe. Feedback loop to propose what we should be offering differently from a kind of commercial standpoint. Total. Totally blind. How much is the level of saving in energy changing, changing our acceptance. Rates? No idea. Because we've gone from, like, having 126 reward to having. Having a 70 pound reward that we're faking a bit higher with a 100 and something pound direct saving. Saving from a fix. I have no idea whether that's made a difference or not. A difference. And whether if that goes up or down, that's going to make another difference. Yeah, which is why the sooner Kevin can get. Through the backlog, urgent backlog, and get into the sort of. The more sensible forward leaning stuff, the better. Stuff. Yeah, exactly. Okay. What's happening on? What's happening on? I gave Ezra the what's happening on Reward dist. Dispensation, who is taking out rewards, who's not. And he did some of it, and then he got bet. Buried. And I put that on Kevin's list. But again, he's not going to get to that for a little while. I'll give you another. Other example, Subscriptions. I have a hunch that we'll discuss. Some quite interesting patterns in which people actually hit Subscribe. So I have this sense that because everyone who came. Through B2B had this kind of sold to them as a this is a free. Thing that work's giving you. They will be less likely to subscribe, but also that they'll be less likely. Likely to have withdrawn their reward. But again, Is what's happening with that whole loop. And what, therefore, should we change about. Are messaging at the beginning. That's another thing I'd love to look at, but that one is too early to look at. I know it's too early to look at, but it will be agree we should within the next two months there'll be data there that will. Interesting stuff. You know, who are. Who are our users? Like we. Know we've got the sort codes of every user and we can split them in game space. Details and how active they've been in the service and who they bank with because I paid so many. Monzo sort codes. I feel like I'm just paying Monzo sort codes all the time. When I was manually doing the payment. Are all our users actually Monzo customers. Is that actually a really key demonstration? Graphic stat. Just feels that way. Love to do the analysis. 4o. Four silk codes. I just felt I was paying the whole time. That's one day. This is what you had yet. Do anything to do it, but let's try and get Kevin. Commercial answers. Yes. Go. Tree right there. John, just. I won't do anything. As the thing unless I hear from you, okay, I. Will tomorrow give you something. Things. Don't. Dave. All right, cool. Cheers. Cheers, guys. Hey. Such a shit chat app. What is it doing my face? Can you see, like, one corner of my face? Yeah. No idea. What? Just move. Up physically. See how it. Cushion slightly to the right. And this is why. Video, that's why. Well, that's. Slightly better. Now you. Now you get a view of my water bottle. Perfect. There you go.",
