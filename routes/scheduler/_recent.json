Bigger tips and classes and stuff. Focus way more. Speaking to Bobby and Elijah has left me wondering what it's like to be a parent of a child. Kicked out of school. I used to work with excluded kids before I was a journalist. But it wasn't until I became a parent and experiencing challenges with my middle child, who's now nine. But I really understood the frustrations. He was getting into trouble a lot, and we were regularly called into the school. Like Bobby. He was eventually given a diagnosis of adhd. Attention deficit hypert. Activity disorder. But unlike Bobby, we got the support we needed within the same school. So I was very interested to hear from Elijah's bad swipe. You agreed to talk to me. What was your first sort of feeling as a parent? Know that your child would be going to a people referral unit. How did that make you feel? I mean, I. I was worrying because there is a stigma for proofs and. He already had issues with behavior beforehand, amongst other things as well.",

But I really understood the frustrations. He was getting into trouble a lot, and we were regularly called into the school. Like Bobby. He was eventually given a diagnosis of adhd. Attention deficit hypert. Activity disorder. But unlike Bobby, we got the support we needed within the same school. So I was very interested to hear from Elijah's bad swipe. You agreed to talk to me. What was your first sort of feeling as a parent? Know that your child would be going to a people referral unit. How did that make you feel? I mean, I. I was worrying because there is a stigma for proofs and. He already had issues with behavior beforehand, amongst other things as well. Well, so to me, it was, he's going from the frying pan into the fire, but. But I didn't really understand what this school was able to.

Bobby's currently doing his GCSEs and is a talented boxer. Keep on missing something. I've had 13 fights, and I've been doing it for at least. You might be not happy, right? I got a book thing called Bully the Bull, so I was going to dress a book thing. For me. That's your nickname, Bobby the ball. So I think what I'm doing right now is putting my hundred percent. Sent to my GCSes. And if that don't go well, I've always got boxing to do. I think that's a. Good things. Keep in mind or. Also got a course in Destin applying. Good luck. Nice one.

And do you feel a lot more happy here? Yeah, I think. In this school anymore than my old school because it's a smaller group, and I think I'm more. More for that than I am. Bigger tips and classes and stuff. Focus way more. Speaking to Bobby and Elijah has left me wondering what it's like to be a parent of a child. Kicked out of school. I used to work with excluded kids before I was a journalist. But it wasn't until I became a parent and experiencing challenges with my middle child, who's now nine. But I really understood the frustrations. He was getting into trouble a lot, and we were regularly called into the school. Like Bobby. He was eventually given a diagnosis of adhd. Attention deficit hypert. Activity disorder. But unlike Bobby, we got the support we needed within the same school. So I was very interested to hear from Elijah's bad swipe. You agreed to talk to me. What was your first sort of feeling as a parent? Know that your child would be going to a people referral unit. How did that make you feel? I mean, I. I was worrying because there is a stigma for proofs and. He already had issues with behavior beforehand, amongst other things as well. Well, so to me, it was, he's going from the frying pan into the fire, but. But I didn't really understand what this school was able to. To offer in terms of support and structure for both students and parents. As well. So, yeah, I was super nervous after, I would say, like, a couple of weeks till. Month, I saw significant improvements in his behavior, in his engagement. That quick? Yeah. Literally that quick for Elijah. Looking back at things, in hindsight, I would have had him come. Here earlier. This is prayer. Okay? Not from my hand. Next up, Vicky, Texas bank of. Corridor to a GCSE English class. What's striking is the small number of pupils. Around eight. They're revising for an exam they will take the next day.",

When you first came though, a year and a half ago, what did you. Did you expect? The pupil referral unit? Kind of sounds a little bit scary. What did you expect when you. When I first arrived, I was expecting it to be like all the. Kids are misbehaved and they're not as relaxing. As they are. So it was different than you expected.
