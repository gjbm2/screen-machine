top:

1. Load schedule (via Alexa) -- show loadable list in display-schedules
2. Unload schedule via Alexa
3. Protected flag at root on schedule script (if set, cannot be unloaded)
4. Get animation working 
5. Set var bugs
6. Have state update in scheduler.tsx so we can test properly 
7. Add comprehensive tests for schedule init, also persistence and set / get vars at diff scopes

1. animate not working properly
2. simplify import to be just from an Enum list

Need to have

1. publishing isn't loading prompts...
7. fullscreenview copes with mp4 and jpg (and works across buckets and generated images)
15. Control schedule from bucket
17. 'load' instruction in scheduler
18. device control calls (in due course)
19. add 'blank'  to front end
20. add 'display next' and 'display random' to front end
21. event triggers to delay schedule



Nice to have 

2. on first page load, soft link to manage images, then unfurl generator section
3. generator tab too prominent
4. Drag & drop to order images
5. burger menu (and remove scripts)
6. home icon 
8. metadata working for bucket images
9. repair rendering status in index
10. "Computer, use AI to schedule" 
12. Slack triggers
13. Temp schedule triggers (poke, user rendered)
15. Samsung ws sync
17. Styletransfer
18. Jinju for workflows (clear up generator.py)
19. general production readiness 
20. move host to friendly url
21. better ws handling
22. important & urgent scheduling
23. async scheduling
24. scheduler passes images in vars (from generate > animate, etc.)
25. shared history workarounds...?

1. Sort out openai latency
        a. splitting out utterance processor (with ssml) from refiner
	b. force ssml return after x seconds by threading utterance processor
	c. include refiner inside generator

2. Get publish contexts working for normal generation (and confirm carried through from url, for end-to-end)

3. For normal generation, take width, height, etc. from workflow unless specified (i.e. remove defaults from workflow) 

4. SD 3.5

5. img-2-img flows

6. debug display OR rebuilt

7. debug fullscreen view (ensure non-mock generator assigns unique batch IDs)
