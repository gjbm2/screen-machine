1. complete image card work on Generated tab
2. show 'cloud' in 'copy to...' context menu

---

1. Load & unload via Alexa 
2. truncate history vars for practical reasons
3. Generally front end is a mess...
4. event triggers definable by a var set to timestamp (for expiry period), then reset upon execution; allows imp exp of triggers
	- related need 'throw' for events across various interfaces


1. split scheduler_utils for performance reasons...
5. add next instruction, loadable scripts to alexa get schedule (rename from get variables)
6. allow generation, animation, with arbitrary list of params (e.g. length=xxx) in instruction
7. paused scheduels after restart get stopped on resume...

Need to have


15. Control schedule from bucket
18. device control calls (in due course)
19. add 'blank'  to front end
20. add 'display next' and 'display random' to front end
21. event triggers to delay schedule
