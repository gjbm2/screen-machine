-1. tests :((((
0. triggers on schedule save (even when shoudlnlt)
1. split scheduler_utils for performance reasons...
2. get scheduler tests working
3. Load schedule (via Alexa) -- show loadable list in display-schedules
4. Unload schedule via Alexa
5. add next instruction, loadable scripts to alexa get schedule (rename from get variables)
6. allow generation, animation, with arbitrary list of params (e.g. length=xxx) in instruction
7. paused scheduels after restart get stopped on resume...
8. dndkit for drag & drop throughout

Need to have

1. publishing isn't loading prompts...
7. fullscreenview copes with mp4 and jpg (and works across buckets and generated images)
15. Control schedule from bucket
17. 'load' instruction in scheduler
18. device control calls (in due course)
19. add 'blank'  to front end
20. add 'display next' and 'display random' to front end
21. event triggers to delay schedule



Nice to have 

2. on first page load, soft link to manage images, then unfurl generator section
3. generator tab too prominent
4. Drag & drop to order images
6. home icon 
8. metadata working for bucket images
9. repair rendering status in index
10. "Computer, use AI to schedule" 
12. Slack triggers
13. Temp schedule triggers (poke, user rendered)
15. Samsung ws sync
17. Styletransfer
18. Jinju for workflows (clear up generator.py)
19. general production readiness 
20. move host to friendly url
21. better ws handling
22. important & urgent scheduling
23. async scheduling
24. scheduler passes images in vars (from generate > animate, etc.)
25. shared history workarounds...?
26. scheduler can appraise images and select the best
