Display:
1. Time / light-sensor driven overlay logic to control intensity
2. Flakey north-screen internet...

Events:
1. Slack triggers

Alexa work:
0. allow group names in instructions
1. Use AI to load ...

UI fixes:
1. Control schedule from bucket
3. tags for images
4. better css for schemaedit
5. when publishing to a currently displayed bucket, we want to avoid a full page refresh -- it's distracting and unnecessary. we only need to refresh the dispaly of the currently published relement. this is triggered from dnd onto own tab OR onto 'currently pbulished' OR using 'publish to' and then choosing own tab. I hope all three go through same code path.. In each case the front end should only update currently published display NOT 
6. few small bugs (favourites, copy to, etc. on recent view)
7. show 'cloud' in 'copy to...' context menu
8. less right & left padding in buckets (on mobile); re-style container css


1. split scheduler_utils for performance reasons...
2. Allow edit of alexa scripts, refiners, etc. through schemaedit
3. allow generation, animation, with arbitrary list of params (e.g. length=xxx) in instruction


Nice to have 

2. on first page load, soft link to manage images, then unfurl generator section
3. generator tab too prominent
9. repair rendering status in index
17. Styletransfer
18. Jinju for workflows (clear up generator.py)
19. general production readiness 
20. move host to friendly url
21. better ws handling
	- currently running jobs details
	- alerts for new bucket additions
25. shared history workarounds...?
27. Lora management component
28. Ursula & Ida lora!
